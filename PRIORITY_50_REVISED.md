## Why These Changes Improve Leverage

### 1. AMT Coverage (Critical Gap Filled)
**Before**: No AMT sections
**After**: Complete AMT framework (§55, §56, §59)

**Why it matters**:
- AMT overrides regular tax rules
- Creates contradictions with other deductions/credits
- Affects high earners disproportionately
- Source of known conflicts in tax code

### 2. Entity Arbitrage Detection
**Added**: §469 (passive losses), §482 (transfer pricing), §267 (related party)

**Why it matters**:
- These sections limit entity structure loopholes
- §469 prevents real estate tax shelters
- §482 prevents international profit shifting
- §267 prevents related party manipulation

### 3. Retirement Account Loopholes
**Added**: §401, §408

**Why it matters**:
- Millions of taxpayers affected
- Known loopholes (backdoor Roth, mega backdoor)
- Entity structuring opportunities (solo 401k)
- High revenue impact

### 4. Wealth Transfer Tax
**Added**: §2001, §2501

**Why it matters**:
- Foundational for estate/gift tax system
- Cross-referenced throughout IRC
- Known loophole areas (valuation, trusts)
- High-net-worth impact

### 5. Post-TCJA Focus
**Added**: §199 (QBI deduction)
**Removed**: §71 (alimony - post-TCJA eliminated)

**Why it matters**:
- §199 is new (2018) and has known issues
- Creates pass-through entity incentives
- Source of planning opportunities
