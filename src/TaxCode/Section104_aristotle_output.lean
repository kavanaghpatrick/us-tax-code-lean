   (a)
   In general
   Except in the case of amounts attributable to (and not in excess of) deductions allowed under section 213 (relating to medical, etc., expenses) for any prior taxable year, gross income does not include—
   (1)
   amounts received under workmen’s
   compensation
   acts as
   compensation
   for personal injuries or sickness;
   (2)
   the amount of any damages (other than punitive damages) received (whether by suit or agreement and whether as lump sums or as periodic payments) on account of personal physical injuries or physical sickness;
   (3)
   amounts received through accident or health insurance (or through an arrangement having the effect of accident or health insurance) for personal injuries or sickness (other than amounts received by an
   employee
   , to the extent such amounts (A) are attributable to contributions by the employer which were not includible in the gross income of the
   employee
   , or (B) are paid by the employer);
   (4)
   amounts received as a pension, annuity, or similar allowance for personal injuries or sickness resulting from active service in the armed forces of any country or in the Coast and Geodetic Survey or the Public Health Service, or as a disability annuity payable under the provisions of section 808 of the
   Foreign Service Act of 1980
   ;

   ); and

   amounts received pursuant to—
   (A)

   [1]
   or
   (B)
   a program established under the laws of any State which provides monetary
   compensation
   for surviving dependents of a public safety officer who has died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty,
   except that subparagraph (B) shall not apply to any amounts that would have been payable if death of the public safety officer had occurred other than as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty.
   For purposes of paragraph (3), in the case of an individual who is, or has been, an
   employee
   within the meaning of section 401(c)(1) (relating to self-employed individuals), contributions made on behalf of such individual while he was such an
   employee
   to a trust described in section 401(a) which is exempt from tax under section 501(a), or under a plan described in section 403(a), shall, to the extent allowed as deductions under section 404, be treated as contributions by the employer which were not includible in the gross income of the
   employee
   . For purposes of paragraph (2), emotional distress shall not be treated as a physical injury or physical sickness. The preceding sentence shall not apply to an amount of damages not in excess of the amount paid for medical care (described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of section 213(d)(1)) attributable to emotional distress.
   (b)
   Termination of application of subsection (a)(4) in certain cases
   (1)
   In general
   Subsection (a)(4) shall not apply in the case of any individual who is not described in paragraph (2).
   (2)
   Individuals to whom subsection (a)(4) continues to apply
   An individual is described in this paragraph if—
   (A)
   on or before
   September 24, 1975
   , he was entitled to receive any amount described in subsection (a)(4),
   (B)

   (C)
   he receives an amount described in subsection (a)(4) by reason of a
   combat-related injury
   , or
   (D)
   on application therefor, he would be entitled to receive disability
   compensation
   from the
   Department of Veterans Affairs
   .
   (3)
   Special rules for combat-related injuries
   For purposes of this subsection, the term “
   combat-related injury

   as a direct result of armed conflict,
   (ii)
   while engaged in extrahazardous service, or

   In the case of an individual who is not described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (2), except as provided in paragraph (4), the only amounts taken into account under subsection (a)(4) shall be the amounts which he receives by reason of a
   combat-related injury
   .
   (4)
   Amount excluded to be not less than veterans’ disability compensation
   In the case of any individual described in paragraph (2), the amounts excludable under subsection (a)(4) for any period with respect to any individual shall not be less than the maximum amount which such individual, on application therefor, would be entitled to receive as disability
   compensation
   from the Veterans’ Administration.
   (c)
   Application of prior law in certain cases
   The phrase “(other than punitive damages)” shall not apply to punitive damages awarded in a civil action—
   (1)
   which is a wrongful death action, and
   (2)
   with respect to which applicable State law (as in effect on
   September 13, 1995
   and without regard to any modification after such date) provides, or has been construed to provide by a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to a decision issued on or before
   September 13, 1995
   , that only punitive damages may be awarded in such an action.
   This subsection shall cease to apply to any civil action filed on or after the first date on which the applicable State law ceases to provide (or is no longer construed to provide) the treatment described in paragraph (2).
