   If a taxpayer changes his
   annual accounting period
   , the new accounting period shall become the taxpayer’s
   taxable year
   only if the change is approved by the Secretary. For purposes of this subtitle, if a taxpayer to whom
   section 441(g)
   applies adopts an
   annual accounting period
   (as defined in section 441(c)) other than a
   calendar year,
   the taxpayer shall be treated as having changed his
   annual accounting period.
