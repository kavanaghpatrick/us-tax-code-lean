   (a)
   General rule
   For purposes of this chapter, if—
   (1)
   there is a
   generation-skipping transfer
   of any property, and
   (2)
   immediately after such transfer such property is held in
   trust
   ,
   for purposes of applying this chapter (other than
   section 2651
   ) to subsequent transfers from the portion of such
   trust
   attributable to such property, the
   trust
   will be treated as if the transferor of such property were assigned to the first generation above the highest generation of any person who has an interest in such
   trust
   immediately after the transfer.
   (b)
   Trust retains inclusion ratio
   (1)
   In general
   Except as provided in paragraph (2), the provisions of subsection (a) shall not affect the inclusion ratio determined with respect to any
   trust
   . Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, proper adjustment shall be made to the inclusion ratio with respect to such
   trust
   to take into account any tax under this chapter borne by such
   trust
   which is imposed by this chapter on the transfer described in subsection (a).
   (2)
   Special rule for pour-over trust
   (A)
   In general
   If the
   generation-skipping transfer
   referred to in subsection (a) involves the transfer of property from 1
   trust
   to another
   trust
   (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as the “pour-over
   trust
   ”), the inclusion ratio for the pour-over
   trust
   shall be determined by treating the nontax portion of such distribution as if it were a part of a GST exemption allocated to such
   trust
   .
   (B)
   Nontax portion
   For purposes of subparagraph (A), the nontax portion of any distribution is the amount of such distribution multiplied by the applicable fraction which applies to such distribution.
