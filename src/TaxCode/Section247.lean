   In general
   In the case of a
   Native Corporation
   , there shall be allowed a deduction for any contributions made by such
   Native Corporation
   to a
   Settlement Trust
   (regardless of whether an election under
   section 646
   is in effect for such
   Settlement Trust)
   for which the
   Native Corporation
   has made an annual election under subsection (e).
   (b)
   Amount of deduction
   The amount of the deduction under subsection (a) shall be equal to—

   in the case of a cash contribution (regardless of the method of payment, including currency, coins, money order, or check), the amount of such contribution, or
   (2)
   in the case of a contribution not described in paragraph (1), the lesser of—
   (A)
   the
   Native Corporation
   ’s adjusted basis in the property contributed, or

   the fair market value of the property contributed.
   (c)
   Limitation and carryover
   (1)
   In general

   Native Corporation
   for the taxable year in which the contribution was made.
   (2)
   Carryover
   If the aggregate amount of contributions described in subsection (a) for any taxable year exceeds the limitation under paragraph (1), such excess shall be treated as a contribution described in subsection (a) in each of the 15 succeeding years in order of time.

   (B)
   for any amounts of the income or gain which are in excess of the amount of income which would be included in income at the time of contribution under subsection (f)(3) but for the taxpayer’s election under this subsection, having the same character as if this subsection did not apply.
