   Normalization Requirements.—

   A normalization method of accounting shall not be treated as being used with respect to any
   public utility property
   for purposes of section 167 or 168 of the
   Internal Revenue Code of 1986
   if the taxpayer, in computing its cost of service for ratemaking purposes and reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account, reduces the excess tax reserve more rapidly or to a greater extent than such reserve would be reduced under the average rate assumption method.
   “(2)
   Definitions.—
   For purposes of this subsection—
   “(A)
   Excess tax reserve.—
   The term ‘excess tax reserve’ means the excess of—
   “(i)
   the reserve for deferred taxes (as described in section 167(l)(3)(G)(ii) or 168(e)(3)(B)(ii) of the
   Internal Revenue Code of 1954
   as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of this Act [
   Oct. 22, 1986
   ]), over
   “(ii)
   the amount which would be the balance in such reserve if the amount of such reserve were determined by assuming that the corporate rate reductions provided in this Act [see Tables for classification] were in effect for all prior periods.
   “(B)
   Average rate assumption method.—
   The average rate assumption method is the method under which the excess in the reserve for deferred taxes is reduced over the remaining lives of the property as used in its regulated books of account which gave rise to the reserve for deferred taxes. Under such method, if timing differences for the property reverse, the amount of the adjustment to the reserve for the deferred taxes is calculated by multiplying—
   “(i)
   the ratio of the aggregate deferred taxes for the property to the aggregate timing differences for the property as of the beginning of the period in question, by
   “(ii)
   the amount of the timing differences which reverse during such period.

   131 Stat. 2099
   , provided that:
   “(1)
   In general.—
   A normalization method of accounting shall not be treated as being used with respect to any
   public utility property
   for purposes of section 167 or 168 of the
   Internal Revenue Code of 1986
   if the taxpayer, in computing its cost of service for ratemaking purposes and reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account, reduces the excess tax reserve more rapidly or to a greater extent than such reserve would be reduced under the average rate assumption method.
   “(2)
   Alternative method for certain taxpayers.—
   If, as of the first day of the taxable year that includes the date of enactment of this Act [
   Dec. 22, 2017
   ]—
   “(A)
   the taxpayer was required by a regulatory agency to compute depreciation for
   public utility property
   on the basis of an average life or composite rate method, and
   “(B)
   the taxpayer’s books and underlying records did not contain the vintage account data necessary to apply the average rate assumption method,
   the taxpayer will be treated as using a normalization method of accounting if, with respect to such jurisdiction, the taxpayer uses the alternative method for
   public utility property
   that is subject to the regulatory authority of that jurisdiction.
   “(3)
   Definitions.—
   For purposes of this subsection—
   “(A)
   Excess tax reserve.—
   The term ‘excess tax reserve’ means the excess of—

   “(ii)
   the amount which would be the balance in such reserve if the amount of such reserve were determined by assuming that the corporate rate reductions provided in this Act [see Tables for classification] were in effect for all prior periods.
   “(B)
   Average rate assumption method.—
   The average rate assumption method is the method under which the excess in the reserve for deferred taxes is reduced over the remaining lives of the property as used in its regulated books of account which gave rise to the reserve for deferred taxes. Under such method, during the time period in which the timing differences for the property reverse, the amount of the adjustment to the reserve for the deferred taxes is calculated by multiplying—
   “(i)
   the ratio of the aggregate deferred taxes for the property to the aggregate timing differences for the property as of the beginning of the period in question, by
   “(ii)
   the amount of the timing differences which reverse during such period.
   “(C)
   Alternative method.—
   The ‘alternative method’ is the method in which the taxpayer—
   “(i)
   computes the excess tax reserve on all
   public utility property
   included in the plant account on the basis of the weighted average life or composite rate used to compute depreciation for regulatory purposes, and
   “(ii)
   reduces the excess tax reserve ratably over the remaining regulatory life of the property.
   “(4)
   Tax increased for normalization violation.—
   If, for any taxable year ending after the date of the enactment of this Act, the taxpayer does not use a normalization method of accounting for the corporate rate reductions provided in the amendments made by this section—
   “(A)
   the taxpayer’s tax for the taxable year shall be increased by the amount by which it reduces its excess tax reserve more rapidly than permitted under a normalization method of accounting, and
   “(B)
   such taxpayer shall not be treated as using a normalization method of accounting for purposes of subsections (f)(2) and (i)(9)(C) of section 168 of the
   Internal Revenue Code of 1986
   .”

   [formerly I.R.C. 1954], or in any regulations prescribed thereunder, shall be treated as making such paragraph inapplicable to any agreement entered into before

   Tax Reform Act of 1984

   Definitions.—
   For purposes of this section—
   “(1)
   Qualified motor vehicle agreement.—
   The term ‘qualified motor vehicle agreement’ means any agreement with respect to a motor vehicle (including a trailer)—
   “(A)
   which was entered into before—
   “(i)
   the enactment of any law, or
   “(ii)
   the publication by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate of any regulation,
   which provides that any agreement with a terminal rental adjustment clause is not a
   lease
   ,
   “(B)
   with respect to which the lessor under the agreement—
   “(i)
   is personally liable for the repayment of, or
   “(ii)
   has pledged property (but only to the extent of the net fair market value of the lessor’s interest in such property), other than property subject to the agreement or property directly or indirectly financed by indebtedness secured by property subject to the agreement, as security for,
   all amounts borrowed to finance the acquisition of property subject to the agreement, and
   “(C)
   with respect to which the lessee under the agreement uses the property subject to the agreement in a trade or business or for the production of income.

   [formerly I.R.C. 1954] which was filed before the date of the enactment of this Act [
   Sept. 3, 1982

   Internal Revenue Code of 1986
   [formerly I.R.C. 1954] with respect to property because, for an accounting period ending after
