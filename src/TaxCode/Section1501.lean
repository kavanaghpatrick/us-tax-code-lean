The making of a consolidated return shall be upon the condition that all corporations which at any time during the taxable year have been members of the
   affiliated group
   consent to all the consolidated return regulations prescribed under section 1502 prior to the last day prescribed by law for the filing of such return. The making of a consolidated return shall be considered as such consent. In the case of a corporation which is a member of the
   affiliated group
   for a fractional part of the year, the consolidated return shall include the income of such corporation for such part of the year as it is a member of the
   affiliated group
