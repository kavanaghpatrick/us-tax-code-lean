   shall apply to the extent that the effect is to treat stock of a
   passive foreign investment company
   as owned by a United States person, and

   (A)
   In general
   If 50 percent or more in value of the stock of a corporation is owned, directly or indirectly, by or for any person, such person shall be considered as owning the stock owned directly or indirectly by or for such corporation in that proportion which the value of the stock which such person so owns bears to the value of all stock in the corporation.
   (B)
   50-percent limitation not to apply to PFIC
   For purposes of determining whether a shareholder of a
   passive foreign investment company
   is treated as owning stock owned directly or indirectly by or for such company, subparagraph (A) shall be applied without regard to the 50-percent limitation contained therein.
   Section 1297(d)

   Options
   To the extent provided in regulations, if any person has an option to acquire stock, such stock shall be considered as owned by such person. For purposes of this paragraph, an option to acquire such an option, and each one of a series of such options, shall be considered as an option to acquire such stock.
   (5)
   Successive application
   Stock considered to be owned by a person by reason of the application of paragraph (2), (3), or (4) shall, for purposes of applying such paragraphs, be considered as actually owned by such person.

   Other special rules
   For purposes of this part—
   (1)
   Time for determination
   Stock held by a taxpayer shall be treated as stock in a
   passive foreign investment company

   passive foreign investment company
   which was not a qualified electing fund. The preceding sentence shall not apply if the taxpayer elects to recognize gain (as of the last day of the last taxable year for which the company was a
   passive foreign investment company
   (determined without regard to the preceding sentence)) under rules similar to the rules of section 1291(d)(2).
   (2)
   Certain corporations not treated as PFIC’s during start-up year
   A corporation shall not be treated as a
   passive foreign investment company

   (A)
   no predecessor of such corporation was a
   passive foreign investment company

   passive foreign investment company
   for any prior taxable year,
   (B)
   it is established to the satisfaction of the Secretary that—

   (ii)
   such corporation will not be a
   passive foreign investment company
   for either of the 1st 2 taxable years following such taxable year, and

   passive foreign investment company

   (i)
   any
   disposition
   by the United States person or the person owning such stock which results in the United States person being treated as no longer owning such stock, or
   (ii)
   any distribution of property in respect of such stock to the person holding such stock,
   shall be treated as a
   disposition
   by, or distribution to, the United States person with respect to the stock in the
   passive foreign investment company
   .
   (B)
   Amount treated in same manner as previously taxed income
   Rules similar to the rules of
   section 959(b)
   shall apply to any amount described in subparagraph (A) and to any amount included in gross income under section 1293(a) (or which would have been so included but for section 951(c)) in respect of stock which the taxpayer is treated as owning under subsection (a).
   (6)
   Dispositions
   Except as provided in regulations, if a taxpayer uses any stock in a
   passive foreign investment company

   If stock in a
   passive foreign investment company
   is owned (or treated as owned under subsection (a)) by a pooled income fund (as defined in section 642(c)(5)) and no portion of any gain from a
   disposition
   of such stock may be allocated to income under the terms of the governing instrument of such fund—
   (1)
   section 1291

   disposition
   of such stock by such fund if (without regard to section 1291) a deduction would be allowable with respect to such gain under section 642(c)(3),
   (2)
   section 1293
   shall not apply with respect to such stock, and

   (A)
   In general
   The amount taken into account under section 1297(a)(2) with respect to any asset to which paragraph (1) applies shall be the unamortized portion (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) of the present value of the payments under the lease for the use of such property.
   (B)
   Present value
   For purposes of subparagraph (A), the present value of payments described in subparagraph (A) shall be determined in the manner provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary—
   (i)
   as of the beginning of the lease term, and

   This subsection shall not apply in any case where—
   (A)
   the lessor is a related person (as defined in
   section 954(d)(3)
   ) with respect to the foreign corporation, or
   (B)
   a principal purpose of leasing the property was to avoid the provisions of this part.
   (e)
   Special rules for certain intangibles
   For purposes of this part—
   (1)
   Research expenditures

   controlled foreign corporation
   shall be increased by the research or experimental expenditures (within the meaning of
