   26 U.S. Code § 1260 - Gains from constructive ownership transactions
   U.S. Code
   Notes
   prev
   | next
   (a)
   In general
   If the taxpayer has gain from a constructive ownership transaction with respect to any
   financial asset
   and such gain would (without regard to this section) be treated as a long-term capital gain—
   (1)
   such gain shall be treated as ordinary income to the extent that such gain exceeds the
   net underlying long-term capital gain
   , and
   (2)
   to the extent such gain is treated as a long-term capital gain after the application of paragraph (1), the determination of the capital gain rate (or rates) applicable to such gain under section 1(h) shall be determined on the basis of the respective rate (or rates) that would have been applicable to the
   net underlying long-term capital gain
   .
   (b)
   Interest charge on deferral of gain recognition
   (1)
   In general
   If any gain is treated as ordinary income for any taxable year by reason of subsection (a)(1), the tax imposed by this chapter for such taxable year shall be increased by the amount of interest determined under paragraph (2) with respect to each prior taxable year during any portion of which the constructive ownership transaction was open. Any amount payable under this paragraph shall be taken into account in computing the amount of any deduction allowable to the taxpayer for interest paid or accrued during such taxable year.
   (2)
   Amount of interest
   The amount of interest determined under this paragraph with respect to a prior taxable year is the amount of interest which would have been imposed under
   section 6601
   on the underpayment of tax for such year which would have resulted if the gain (which is treated as ordinary income by reason of subsection (a)(1)) had been included in gross income in the taxable years in which it accrued (determined by treating the income as accruing at a constant rate equal to the applicable Federal rate as in effect on the day the transaction closed). The period during which such interest shall accrue shall end on the due date (without extensions) for the return of tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year in which such transaction closed.
   (3)
   Applicable Federal rate
   For purposes of paragraph (2), the applicable Federal rate is the applicable Federal rate determined under
   section 1274(d)
   (compounded semiannually) which would apply to a debt instrument with a term equal to the period the transaction was open.
   (4)
   No credits against increase in tax
   Any increase in tax under paragraph (1) shall not be treated as tax imposed by this chapter for purposes of determining—
   (A)
   the amount of any credit allowable under this chapter, or
   (B)
   the amount of the tax imposed by section 55.
   (c)
   Financial asset
   For purposes of this section—
   (1)
   In general
   The term “
   financial asset
   ” means—
   (A)
   any equity interest in any
   pass-thru entity
   , and
   (B)
   to the extent provided in regulations—
   (i)
   any debt instrument, and
   (ii)
   any
   stock
   in a corporation which is not a
   pass-thru entity
   .
   (2)
   Pass-thru entity
   For purposes of paragraph (1), the term “
   pass-thru entity
   ” means—
   (A)
   a regulated investment company,
   (B)
   a real estate investment trust,
   (C)
   an S corporation,
   (D)
   a partnership,
   (E)
   a trust,
   (F)
   a common trust fund,
   (G)
   a passive foreign investment company (as defined in
   section 1297
   without regard to subsection (d) thereof), and
   (H)
   a REMIC.
   (d)
   Constructive ownership transaction
   For purposes of this section—
   (1)
   In general
   The taxpayer shall be treated as having entered into a constructive ownership transaction with respect to any
   financial asset
   if the taxpayer—
   (A)
   holds a long position under a notional principal contract with respect to the
   financial asset
   ,
   (B)
   enters into a forward or futures contract to acquire the
   financial asset
   ,
   (C)
   is the holder of a call
   option
   , and is the grantor of a put
   option
   , with respect to the
   financial asset
   and such
   options
   have substantially equal strike prices and substantially contemporaneous maturity dates, or
   (D)
   to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, enters into one or more other transactions (or acquires one or more positions) that have substantially the same effect as a transaction described in any of the preceding subparagraphs.
   (2)
   Exception for positions which are marked to market
   This section shall not apply to any constructive ownership transaction if all of the positions which are part of such transaction are marked to market under any provision of this title or the regulations thereunder.
   (3)
   Long position under notional principal contract
   A person shall be treated as holding a long position under a notional principal contract with respect to any
   financial asset
   if such person—
   (A)
   has the right to be paid (or receive credit for) all or substantially all of the investment yield (including appreciation) on such
   financial asset
   for a specified period, and
   (B)
   is obligated to reimburse (or provide credit for) all or substantially all of any decline in the value of such
   financial asset
   .
   (4)
   Forward contract
   The term “
   forward contract
   ” means any contract to acquire in the future (or provide or receive credit for the future value of) any
   financial asset.
   (e)
   Net underlying long-term capital gain
   For purposes of this section, in the case of any constructive ownership transaction with respect to any
   financial asset
   , the term “
   net underlying long-term capital gain
   ” means the aggregate net capital gain that the taxpayer would have had if—
   (1)
   the
   financial asset
   had been acquired for fair market value on the date such transaction was opened and sold for fair market value on the date such transaction was closed, and
   (2)
   only gains and losses that would have resulted from the deemed ownership under paragraph (1) were taken into account.
   The amount of the
   net underlying long-term capital gain
   with respect to any
   financial asset
   shall be treated as zero unless the amount thereof is established by clear and convincing evidence.
   (f)
   Special rule where taxpayer takes delivery
   Except as provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, if a constructive ownership transaction is closed by reason of taking delivery, this section shall be applied as if the taxpayer had sold all the contracts,
   options
   , or other positions which are part of such transaction for fair market value on the closing date. The amount of gain recognized under the preceding sentence shall not exceed the amount of gain treated as ordinary income under subsection (a). Proper adjustments shall be made in the amount of any gain or loss subsequently realized for gain recognized and treated as ordinary income under this subsection.
   (g)
   Regulations
   The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section, including regulations—
   (1)
   to permit taxpayers to mark to market constructive ownership transactions in lieu of applying this section, and
   (2)
   to exclude certain
   forward contracts
   which do not convey substantially all of the economic return with respect to a
   financial asset.
