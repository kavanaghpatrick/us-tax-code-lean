   (a)
   General rule
   No deduction shall be allowed for any
   interest
   paid or incurred by a corporation during the taxable year with respect to its
   corporate acquisition indebtedness
   to the extent that such
   interest
   exceeds—
   (1)
   $5,000,000, reduced by
   (2)
   the amount of
   interest
   paid or incurred by such corporation during such year on obligations (A) issued to provide consideration for an acquisition described in paragraph (1) of subsection (b), but (B) which are not
   corporate acquisition indebtedness
   .
   (b)
   Corporate acquisition indebtedness
   For purposes of this section, the term “
   corporate acquisition indebtedness
   ” means any obligation evidenced by a bond, debenture, note, or certificate or other evidence of indebtedness issued by a corporation (hereinafter in this section referred to as “issuing corporation”) if—
   (1)
   such obligation is issued to provide consideration for the acquisition of—
   (A)
   stock in another corporation (hereinafter in this section referred to as “acquired corporation”), or
   (B)
   assets of another corporation (hereinafter in this section referred to as “acquired corporation”) pursuant to a plan under which at least two-thirds (in value) of all the assets (excluding money) used in trades and businesses carried on by such corporation are acquired,
   (2)
   such obligation is either—
   (A)
   subordinated to the claims of trade creditors of the issuing corporation generally, or
   (B)
   expressly subordinated in right of payment to the payment of any substantial amount of unsecured indebtedness, whether outstanding or subsequently issued, of the issuing corporation,
   (3)
   the bond or other evidence of indebtedness is either—
   (A)
   convertible directly or indirectly into stock of the issuing corporation, or
   (B)
   part of an investment unit or other arrangement which includes, in addition to such bond or other evidence of indebtedness, an option to acquire, directly or indirectly, stock in the issuing corporation, and
   (4)
   as of a day determined under subsection (c)(1), either—
   (A)
   the
   ratio of debt to equity
   (as defined in subsection (c)(2)) of the issuing corporation exceeds 2 to 1, or
   (B)
   the
   projected earnings
   (as defined in subsection (c)(3)) do not exceed 3 times the
   annual interest to be paid or incurred
   (determined under subsection (c)(4)).
   (c)
   Rules for application of subsection (b)(4)
   For purposes of subsection (b)(4)—
   (1)
   Time of determination
   Determinations are to be made as of the last day of any taxable year of the issuing corporation in which it issues any obligation to provide consideration for an acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of stock in, or assets of, the acquired corporation.
   (2)
   Ratio of debt to equity
   The term “
   ratio of debt to equity
   ” means the ratio which the total indebtedness of the issuing corporation bears to the sum of its money and all its other assets (in an amount equal to their adjusted basis for determining gain) less such total indebtedness.
   (3)
   Projected earnings
   (A)
   The term “
   projected earnings
   ” means the “average annual earnings” (as defined in subparagraph (B)) of—
   (i)
   the issuing corporation only, if clause (ii) does not apply, or
   (ii)
   both the issuing corporation and the acquired corporation, in any case where the issuing corporation has acquired control (as defined in section 368(c)), or has acquired substantially all of the properties, of the acquired corporation.
   (B)
   The average annual earnings referred to in subparagraph (A) is, for any corporation, the amount of its earnings and profits for any 3-year period ending with the last day of a taxable year of the issuing corporation described in paragraph (1), computed without reduction for—
   (i)
   interest
   paid or incurred,
   (ii)
   depreciation or amortization allowed under this chapter,
   (iii)
   liability for tax under this chapter, and
   (iv)
   distributions to which
   section 301(c)(1)
   applies (other than such distributions from the acquired to the issuing corporation),
   and reduced to an annual average for such 3-year period pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary. Such regulations shall include rules for cases where any corporation was not in existence for all of such 3-year period or such period includes only a portion of a taxable year of any corporation.
   (4)
   Annual interest to be paid or incurred
   The term “
   annual interest to be paid or incurred
   ” means—
   (A)
   if subparagraph (B) does not apply, the
   annual interest to be paid or incurred
   by the issuing corporation only, determined by reference to its total indebtedness outstanding, or
   (B)
   if
   projected earnings
   are determined under clause (ii) of paragraph (3)(A), the
   annual interest to be paid or incurred
   by both the issuing corporation and the acquired corporation, determined by reference to their combined total indebtedness outstanding.
   (5)
   Special rules for banks and lending or finance companies
   With respect to any corporation which is a bank (as defined in
   section 581
   ) or is primarily engaged in a
   lending or finance business—
   (A)
   in determining under paragraph (2) the
   ratio of debt to equity
   of such corporation (or of the
   affiliated group
   of which such corporation is a member), the total indebtedness of such corporation (and the assets of such corporation) shall be reduced by an amount equal to the total indebtedness owed to such corporation which arises out of the banking business of such corporation, or out of the
   lending or finance business
   of such corporation, as the case may be;
   (B)
   in determining under paragraph (4) the
   annual interest to be paid or incurred
   by such corporation (or by the issuing and acquired corporations referred to in paragraph (4)(B) or by the
   affiliated group
   of which such corporation is a member) the amount of such
   interest
   (determined without regard to this paragraph) shall be reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of such
   interest
   as the amount of the reduction for the taxable year under subparagraph (A) bears to the total indebtedness of such corporation; and
   (C)
   in determining under paragraph (3)(B) the average annual earnings, the amount of the earnings and profits for the 3-year period shall be reduced by the sum of the reductions under subparagraph (B) for such period.
   For purposes of this paragraph, the term “
   lending or finance business
   ” means a business of making loans or purchasing or discounting accounts receivable, notes, or installment obligations.
   (d)
   Taxable years to which applicable
   In applying this section—
   (1)
   First year of disallowance
   The deduction of
   interest
   on any obligation shall not be disallowed under subsection (a) before the first taxable year of the issuing corporation as of the last day of which the application of either subparagraph (A) or subparagraph (B) of subsection (b)(4) results in such obligation being
   corporate acquisition indebtedness
   .
   (2)
   General rule for succeeding years
   Except as provided in paragraphs (3), (4), and (5), if an obligation is determined to be
   corporate acquisition indebtedness
   as of the last day of any taxable year of the issuing corporation, it shall be
   corporate acquisition indebtedness
   for such taxable year and all subsequent taxable years.
   (3)
   Redetermination where control, etc., is acquired
   If an obligation is determined to be
   corporate acquisition indebtedness
   as of the close of a taxable year of the issuing corporation in which clause (i) of subsection (c)(3)(A) applied, but would not be
   corporate acquisition indebtedness
   if the determination were made as of the close of the first taxable year of such corporation thereafter in which clause (ii) of subsection (c)(3)(A) could apply, such obligation shall be considered not to be
   corporate acquisition indebtedness
   for such later taxable year and all taxable years thereafter.
   (4)
   Special 3-year rule
   If an obligation which has been determined to be
   corporate acquisition indebtedness
   for any taxable year would not be such indebtedness for each of any 3 consecutive taxable years thereafter if subsection (b)(4) were applied as of the close of each of such 3 years, then such obligation shall not be
   corporate acquisition indebtedness
   for all taxable years after such 3 consecutive taxable years.
   (5)
   5 percent stock rule
   In the case of obligations issued to provide consideration for the acquisition of stock in another corporation, such obligations shall be
   corporate acquisition indebtedness
   for a taxable year only if at some time before the close of such year the issuing corporation owns 5 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of such other corporation.
   (e)
   Certain nontaxable transactions
   An acquisition of stock of a corporation of which the issuing corporation is in control (as defined in
   section 368(c)
   ) in a transaction in which gain or loss is not recognized shall be deemed an acquisition described in paragraph (1) of subsection (b) only if immediately before such transaction (1) the acquired corporation was in existence, and (2) the issuing corporation was not in control (as defined in section 368(c)) of such corporation.
   (f)
   Exemption for certain acquisitions of foreign corporations
   For purposes of this section, the term “
   corporate acquisition indebtedness
   ” does not include any indebtedness issued to any person to provide consideration for the acquisition of stock in, or assets of, any foreign corporation substantially all of the income of which, for the 3-year period ending with the date of such acquisition or for such part of such period as the foreign corporation was in existence, is from sources without the United States.
   (g)
   Affiliated groups
   In any case in which the issuing corporation is a member of an
   affiliated group
   , the application of this section shall be determined, pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by treating all of the members of the
   affiliated group
   in the aggregate as the issuing corporation, except that the
   ratio of debt to equity
   of,
   projected earnings
   of, and
   annual interest to be paid or incurred
   by any corporation (other than the issuing corporation determined without regard to this subsection) shall be included in the determinations required under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (b)(4) as of any day only if such corporation is a member of the
   affiliated group
   on such day, and, in determining
   projected earnings
   of such corporation under subsection (c)(3), there shall be taken into account only the earnings and profits of such corporation for the period during which it was a member of the
   affiliated group.
   For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term
   “affiliated group”
   has the meaning assigned to such term by section 1504(a), except that all corporations other than the acquired corporation shall be treated as includible corporations (without any exclusion under section 1504(b)) and the acquired corporation shall not be treated as an includible corporation.
   (h)
   Changes in obligation
   For purposes of this section—
   (1)
   Any extension, renewal, or refinancing of an obligation evidencing a preexisting indebtedness shall not be deemed to be the issuance of a new obligation.
   (2)
   Any obligation which is
   corporate acquisition indebtedness
   of the issuing corporation is also
   corporate acquisition indebtedness
   of any corporation which becomes liable for such obligation as guarantor, endorser, or indemnitor or which assumes liability for such obligation in any transaction.
   (i)
   Effect on other provisions
   No inference shall be drawn from any provision in this section that any instrument designated as a bond, debenture, note, or certificate or other evidence of indebtedness by its issuer represents an obligation or indebtedness of such issuer in applying any other provision of this title.
