   plan
   of an
   eligible employer
   described in subsection (e)(1)(A), and

   described in subsection (e)(1)(B).

   To the extent provided in section 72(t)(9),
   section 72(t)

   In the case of a
   plan
   of an
   eligible employer
   described in subsection (e)(1)(A), to the extent provided in section 402(l), paragraph (1) shall not apply to amounts otherwise includible in gross income under this subsection.
   (b)
   Eligible deferred compensation plan defined
   For purposes of this section, the term “
   eligible deferred compensation plan
   ” means a
   plan
   established and maintained by an
   eligible employer—
   (1)
   in which only individuals who perform service for the employer may be
   participants
   ,
   (2)
   which provides that (except as provided in paragraph (3)) the maximum amount which may be deferred under the
   plan
   for the taxable year (other than rollover amounts) shall not exceed the lesser of—
   (A)
   the applicable dollar amount, or
   (B)
   100 percent of the
   participant
   ’s
   includible compensation
   ,
   (3)
   which may provide that, for 1 or more of the
   participant
   ’s last 3 taxable years ending before he attains normal retirement age under the
   plan,
   the ceiling set forth in paragraph (2) shall be the lesser of—
   (A)
   twice the dollar amount in effect under subsection (b)(2)(A), or
   (B)
   the sum of—
   (i)
   the
   plan

   so much of the
   plan
   ceiling established for purposes of paragraph (2) for taxable years before the taxable year as has not previously been used under paragraph (2) or this paragraph,
   (4)
   which provides that compensation—
   (A)
   in the case of an
   eligible employer
   described in subsection (e)(1)(A), will be deferred only if an agreement providing for such deferral has been entered into before the compensation is currently available to the individual, and
   (B)
   in any other case, will be deferred for any calendar month only if an agreement providing for such deferral has been entered into before the beginning of such month,
   (5)
   which meets the distribution requirements of subsection (d), and
   (6)
   except as provided in subsection (g), which provides that—
   (A)
   all amounts of compensation deferred under the
   plan
   ,
   (B)
   all property and rights purchased with such amounts, and
   (C)
   all income attributable to such amounts, property, or rights,
   shall remain (until made available to the
   participant
   or other
   beneficiary
   ) solely the property and rights of the employer (without being restricted to the provision of benefits under the
   plan)
   , subject only to the claims of the employer’s general creditors.
   A
   plan
   which is established and maintained by an employer which is described in subsection (e)(1)(A) and which is administered in a manner which is inconsistent with the requirements of any of the preceding paragraphs shall be treated as not meeting the requirements of such paragraph as of the 1st
   plan
   year beginning more than 180 days after the date of notification by the Secretary of the inconsistency unless the employer corrects the inconsistency before the 1st day of such
   plan
   year. A
   plan
   which is established and maintained by an employer which is described in subsection (e)(1)(A) shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subsection solely because the
   plan
   , or another
   plan
   maintained by the employer which meets the requirements of
   section 401(a)
   or 403(b), provides for matching contributions on account of qualified student loan payments as described in section 401(m)(13).
   (c)
   Limitation
   The maximum amount of the compensation of any one individual which may be deferred under subsection (a) during any taxable year shall not exceed the amount in effect under subsection (b)(2)(A) (as modified by any adjustment provided under subsection (b)(3)).
   (d)
   Distribution requirements
   (1)
   In general
   For purposes of subsection (b)(5), a

   plan
   amounts will not be made available to
   participants
   or beneficiaries earlier than—
   (i)
   the calendar year in which the
   participant
   attains age 70½ (in the case of a
   plan
   maintained by an employer described in subsection (e)(1)(A), age 59½),
   (ii)
   when the
   participant
   has a severance from employment with the employer,
   (iii)
   when the
   participant
   is faced with an unforeseeable emergency (determined in the manner prescribed by the Secretary in regulations),
   (iv)
   except as may be otherwise provided by regulations, in the case of a
   plan
   maintained by an employer described in subsection (e)(1)(A), with respect to amounts invested in a lifetime income investment (as defined in
   section 401(a)(38)(B)(ii)
   ), the date that is 90 days prior to the date that such lifetime income investment may no longer be held as an investment option under the
   plan,
   or

   as provided in section 401(a)(39),
   (B)
   the

   ) or a qualified
   plan

   section 401(a)(31)
   shall not be includible in gross income for the taxable year of transfer.
   (2)
   Minimum distribution requirements
   A
   plan
   meets the minimum distribution requirements of this paragraph if such
   plan
   meets the requirements of section 401(a)(9).
   (3)
   Special rule for government plan
   An
   eligible deferred compensation plan
   of an employer described in subsection (e)(1)(A) shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subsection solely by reason of making a distribution described in subsection (e)(9)(A).
   (4)
   Participant certification
   In determining whether a distribution to a
   participant
   is made when the
   participant
   is faced with an unforeseeable emergency, the administrator of a
   plan
   maintained by an
   eligible employer
   described in subsection (e)(1)(A) may rely on a written certification by the
   participant
   that the distribution is—
   (A)
   made when the
   participant
   is faced with an unforeseeable emergency of a type which is described in regulations prescribed by the Secretary as an unforeseeable emergency, and
   (B)
   not in excess of the amount required to satisfy the emergency need, and
   that the
   participant
   has no alternative means reasonably available to satisfy such emergency need. The Secretary may provide by regulations for exceptions to the rule of the preceding sentence in cases where the
   plan
   administrator has actual knowledge to the contrary of the
   participant
   ’s certification, and for procedures for addressing cases of
   participant
   misrepresentation.
