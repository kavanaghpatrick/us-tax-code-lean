   General rule
   There is hereby imposed (in addition to any other tax imposed by this subtitle) a tax equal to the excess (if any) of—
   (1)
   the tentative minimum tax for the taxable year, over
   (2)
   the

   (b)

   In the case of a taxpayer other than a corporation—
   (A)
   In general
   The tentative minimum tax for the taxable year is the sum of—
   (i)
   26 percent of so much of the
   taxable excess
   as does not exceed $175,000, plus
   (ii)
   28 percent of so much of the
   taxable excess
   as exceeds $175,000.
   The amount determined under the preceding sentence shall be reduced by the alternative minimum tax foreign tax credit for the taxable year.
   (B)
   Taxable excess
   For purposes of this subsection, the term “

   ” means so much of the
   alternative minimum taxable income
   for the taxable year as exceeds the

   In the case of a married individual filing a separate return, subparagraph (A) shall be applied by substituting 50 percent of the dollar amount otherwise applicable under clause (i) and clause (ii) thereof. For purposes of the preceding sentence, marital status shall be determined under section 7703.
   (D)
   Alternative minimum taxable income
   The term “

   (i)
   determined with the adjustments provided in section 56 and section 58, and
   (ii)
   increased by the amount of the items of tax preference described in section 57.
   If a taxpayer is subject to the
   regular tax
   , such taxpayer shall be subject to the tax imposed by this section (and, if the
   regular tax
   is determined by reference to an amount other than taxable income, such amount shall be treated as the taxable income of such taxpayer for purposes of the preceding sentence).
   (2)
   Corporations
   (A)
   Applicable corporations
   In the case of an applicable corporation, the tentative minimum tax for the taxable year shall be the excess of—

   the corporate AMT foreign tax credit for the taxable year.
   (B)
   Other corporations
   In the case of any corporation which is not an applicable corporation, the tentative minimum tax for the taxable year shall be zero.
   (3)
   Maximum rate of tax on net capital gain of noncorporate taxpayers
   The amount determined under the first sentence of paragraph (1)(A) shall not exceed the sum of—
   (A)
   the amount determined under such first sentence computed at the rates and in the same manner as if this paragraph had not been enacted on the
   taxable excess
   reduced by the lesser of—
   (i)
   the net capital gain; or
   (ii)
   the sum of—
   (I)
   the adjusted net capital gain, plus
   (II)
   the unrecaptured
   section 1250
   gain, plus
   (B)
   0 percent of so much of the adjusted net capital gain (or, if less,
   taxable excess
   ) as does not exceed an amount equal to the excess described in section 1(h)(1)(B), plus
   (C)
   15 percent of the lesser of—
   (i)
   so much of the adjusted net capital gain (or, if less,
   taxable excess
   ) as exceeds the amount on which tax is determined under subparagraph (B), or
   (ii)
   the excess described in section 1(h)(1)(C)(ii), plus
   (D)
   20 percent of the adjusted net capital gain (or, if less,
   taxable excess
   ) in excess of the sum of the amounts on which tax is determined under subparagraphs (B) and (C), plus
   (E)
   25 percent of the amount of
   taxable excess
   in excess of the sum of the amounts on which tax is determined under the preceding subparagraphs of this paragraph.
