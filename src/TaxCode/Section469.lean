   (B)
   Income in subsequent years
   If any taxpayer has any loss for any taxable year from a working interest in any oil or gas property which is treated as a loss which is not from a

   passive activity
   . If the preceding sentence applies to the net income from any property for any taxable year, any credits allowable under subpart B (other than section 27) or D of part IV of subchapter A for such taxable year which are attributable to such property shall be treated as credits not from a

   passive activity credit
   of the taxpayer.

   If a taxpayer ceases for any taxable year to be a
   closely held C corporation
   or
   personal service corporation

   former passive activity
   ” means any activity which, with respect to the taxpayer—

   for the taxable year, but

   passive activity
   (or
   former passive activity
   ), the following rules shall apply:
   (1)
   Fully taxable transaction
   (A)
   In general
   If all gain or loss realized on such
   disposition
   is recognized, the excess of—
   (i)
   any loss from such activity for such taxable year (determined after the application of subsection (b)), over
   (ii)
   any net income or gain for such taxable year from all other passive activities (determined after the application of subsection (b)),
   shall be treated as a loss which is not from a
   passive activity
   .
   (B)
   Subparagraph (A) not to apply to disposition involving related party
   If the taxpayer and the person acquiring the interest bear a relationship to each other described in section 267(b) or section 707(b)(1), then subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any loss of the taxpayer until the taxable year in which such interest is acquired (in a transaction described in subparagraph (A)) by another person who does not bear such a relationship to the tax­payer.
   (C)
   Income from prior years
   To the extent provided in regulations, income or gain from the activity for preceding taxable years shall be taken into account under subparagraph (A)(ii) for the taxable year to the extent necessary to prevent the avoidance of this section.
   (2)
   Disposition by death
   If an interest in the activity is transferred by reason of the death of the taxpayer—
   (A)
   paragraph (1)(A) shall apply to losses described in paragraph (1)(A) to the extent such losses are greater than the excess (if any) of—

   (ii)
   the adjusted basis of such property immediately before the death of the taxpayer, and
   (B)

   continuous, and
   (C)
   substantial.

   Except as provided in regulations, no interest in a limited partnership as a limited partner shall be treated as an interest with respect to which a taxpayer materially participates.
   (3)
   Treatment of certain retired individuals and surviving spouses
   A taxpayer shall be treated as materially participating in any farming activity for a taxable year if paragraph (4) or (5) of
   section 2032A(b)
   would cause the requirements of section 2032A(b)(1)(C)(ii) to be met with respect to real property used in such activity if such taxpayer had died during the taxable year.
   (4)
   Certain closely held C corporations and personal service corporations
   A

   passive activity credit
   for any taxable year which is attributable to all rental real estate activities with respect to which such individual actively participated in such taxable year (and if any portion of such loss or credit arose in another taxable year, in such other taxable year).
