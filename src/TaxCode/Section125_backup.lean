   employee
   who ceases participation in the plan during calendar year 2020 or 2021 to continue to receive reimbursements from unused benefits or contributions through the end of the plan year in which such participation ceased (including any grace period, taking into account any modification of a grace period permitted under paragraph (1)).

   “(ii)
   in the case of an
   employee
   who (after the application of this section) has an unused balance in the

   ’s account under such arrangement for such plan year (determined as of the close of the last day on which, under the terms of the plan, claims for reimbursement may be made with respect to such plan year), the subsequent plan year.
   “(e)

   cafeteria plan

   merely because such plan or arrangement allows an
   employee
   to make an election to modify prospectively the amount (but not in excess of any applicable dollar limitation) of such
   employee’
   s contributions to any such flexible spending arrangement (without regard to any change in status).
   “(f)
   Definitions.—
   Any term used in this section which is also used in section 106, 125, or 129 of the

   , or the regulations or guidance thereunder, shall have the same meaning as when used in such section, regulations, or guidance.
   “(g)
   Plan Amendments.—
   A plan that includes a health flexible spending arrangement or dependent care flexible spending arrangement shall not fail to be treated as a
   cafeteria plan

   “(1)
   such amendment is adopted not later than the last day of the first calendar year beginning after the end of the plan year in which the amendment is effective, and

   “(A)
   General transitional rule.—
   Any
   cafeteria plan
   in existence on
   February 10, 1984
   , which failed as of such date and continued to fail thereafter to satisfy the rules relating to
   section 125
   under proposed Treasury regulations, and any benefit offered under such a
   cafeteria plan
   which failed as of such date and continued to fail thereafter to satisfy the rules of section 105, 106, 120, or 129 under proposed Treasury regulations, will not fail to be a
   cafeteria plan
   under section 125 or a nontaxable benefit under section 105, 106, 120, or 129 solely because of such failures. The preceding sentence shall apply only with respect to
   cafeteria plans
   and benefits provided under
   cafeteria plans
   before the earlier of—
   “(i)
   January 1, 1985
   , or

   105
   ,
   106
   ,
   120
   , or
   129
   under proposed Treasury regulations because an
   employee

The preceding sentence shall apply only with respect to benefits provided under
   cafeteria plans
   before the earlier of—
   “(i)
   July 1, 1985
   , or
   “(ii)
   the effective date of any modification to provide additional benefits after
   February 10, 1984
   .
   Except as provided in Treasury regulations, the special transition rule is available only for benefits with respect to which, after
   December 31, 1984
   , contributions are fixed before the period of coverage and taxable cash is not available until the end of such period of coverage.
   “(C)
   Plans for which substantial implementation costs were incurred.—
   For purposes of this paragraph, any plan with respect to which substantial implementation costs had been incurred before
   February 10, 1984

   ) shall be substituted for ‘
   January 1, 1985
   ’ in subparagraph (A) and for ‘
   July 1, 1985
   ’ in subparagraph (B). For purposes of the preceding sentence, any plan amendment made pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement relating to the plan which amends the plan solely to conform to any requirement added by this section (or any requirement in the regulations under section 125 of the
   Internal Revenue Code of 1954
   [now 1986] proposed on
   May 6, 1984
   ) shall not be treated as a termination of such collective bargaining agreement.
   “(E)
   Special rule where contributions or reimbursements suspended.—
   For purposes of subparagraphs (A) and (B), a plan shall not be treated as not continuing to fail to satisfy the rules referred to in such subparagraphs with respect to any benefit provided in the form of a flexible spending arrangement merely because contributions or reimbursements (or both) with respect to such plan were suspended before
   January 1, 1985
