   any contribution by any governmental entity or civic group (other than a contribution made by a shareholder as such).
   (c)
   Special rules for water and sewerage disposal utilities
   (1)
   General rule
   For purposes of this section, the term “
   contribution to the capital of the taxpayer
   ” includes any amount of money or other property received from any person (whether or not a shareholder) by a
   regulated public utility
   which provides water or sewerage disposal services if—
   (A)
   such amount is—
   (i)
   a
   contribution in aid of construction
   , or
   (ii)
   a contribution to the capital of such utility by a governmental entity providing for the protection, preservation, or enhancement of drinking water or sewerage disposal services,
   (B)
   in the case of a
   contribution in aid of construction
   which is property other than water or sewerage disposal facilities, such amount meets the requirements of the expenditure rule of paragraph (2), and
   (C)
   such amount (or any property acquired or constructed with such amount) is not included in the taxpayer’s rate base for ratemaking purposes.
   (2)
   Expenditure rule
   An amount meets the requirements of this paragraph if—
   (A)
   an amount equal to such amount is expended for the acquisition or construction of tangible property described in
   section 1231(b)
   —
   (i)
   which is the property for which the contribution was made or is of the same type as such property, and

   ” shall be defined by regulations prescribed by the Secretary, except that such term shall not include amounts paid as service charges for starting or stopping services.
   (B)
   Predominantly
   The term “
   predominantly
   ” means 80 percent or more.
   (C)
   Regulated public utility
   The term “
   regulated public utility
   ” has the meaning given such term by section 7701(a)(33), except that such term shall not include any utility which is not required to provide water or sewerage disposal services to members of the general public in its service area.

   contribution in aid of construction
   to which this subsection applies. The adjusted basis of any property acquired with contributions in aid of construction to which this subsection applies shall be zero.
   (d)
   Statute of limitations
   If the taxpayer for any taxable year treats an amount as a
   contribution to the capital of the taxpayer
   described in subsection (c)(1)(A)(i), then—
   (1)
   the statutory period for the assessment of any deficiency attributable to any part of such amount shall not expire before the expiration of 3 years from the date the Secretary is notified by the taxpayer (in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe) of—
   (A)
