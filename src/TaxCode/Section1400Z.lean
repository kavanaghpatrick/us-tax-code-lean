IRC Section 1400Z - Qualified Opportunity Zones

The Opportunity Zone program (§1400Z-1 and §1400Z-2) provides significant
capital gains tax benefits for investments in designated low-income communities.

Key loophole mechanics:
- 180-day investment window (timing flexibility)
- Basis step-up at 5 and 7 years (10%/15% of original gain excluded)
- Complete exclusion of appreciation after 10 years
- 90% asset test (manipulation potential)
- Multiple eligible gains can be rolled into single QOF

This is one of the most significant tax planning opportunities post-2017.
