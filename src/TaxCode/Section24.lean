   (B)
   the amount by which the aggregate amount of credits allowed by this subpart (determined without regard to this subsection) would increase if the limitation imposed by

   were increased by the greater of—
   (i)
   15 percent of so much of the taxpayer’s
   earned income
   (within the meaning of
   section 32
   ) which is taken into account in computing taxable income for the taxable year as exceeds $3,000, or
