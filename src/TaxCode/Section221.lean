   (d)
   Definitions
   For purposes of this section—
   (1)
   Qualified education loan
   The term “
   qualified education loan
   ” means any indebtedness incurred by the taxpayer solely to pay
   qualified higher education expenses
   —
   (A)
   which are incurred on behalf of the taxpayer, the taxpayer’s spouse, or any
   dependent
   of the taxpayer as of the time the indebtedness was incurred,
   (B)
   which are paid or incurred within a reasonable period of time before or after the indebtedness is incurred, and
   (C)
   which are attributable to education furnished during a period during which the recipient was an
   eligible student
   .
   Such term includes indebtedness used to refinance indebtedness which qualifies as a
   qualified education loan
   . The term “
   qualified education loan
   ” shall not include any indebtedness owed to a person who is related (within the meaning of section
   267(b)
   or
   707(b)(1)
   ) to the taxpayer or to any person by reason of a loan under any qualified employer plan (as defined in section 72(p)(4)) or under any contract referred to in section 72(p)(5).
   (2)
   Qualified higher education expenses
   The term “
   qualified higher education expenses
   ” means the cost of attendance (as defined in section 472 of the
   Higher Education Act of 1965
   ,
   20 U.S.C. 1087
   ll
   , as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the
   Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997
   ) at an
   eligible educational institution,
   reduced by the sum of—
   (A)
   the amount excluded from gross income under section
   127
   ,
   135
   ,
   529
   , or
   530
   by reason of such expenses, and
   (B)
   the amount of any scholarship, allowance, or payment described in section 25A(g)(2).
   For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “
   eligible educational institution
   ” has the same meaning given such term by section 25A(f)(2), except that such term shall also include an institution conducting an internship or residency program leading to a degree or certificate awarded by an institution of higher education, a hospital, or a health care facility which offers postgraduate training.
   (3)

   eligible student
   ” has the meaning given such term by section 25A(b)(3).

   (determined without regard to subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), and (d)(1)(B) thereof).
   (e)
   Special rules
   (1)
   Denial of double benefit
   No deduction shall be allowed under this section for any amount for which a deduction is allowable under any other provision of this chapter, or for which an exclusion is allowable under section 127 to the taxpayer by reason of the payment by the taxpayer’s employer of any indebtedness on a
   qualified education loan
   of the taxpayer. The deduction otherwise allowable under subsection (a) (prior to the application of subsection (b)) to the taxpayer for any taxable year shall be reduced (but not below zero) by so much of the distributions treated as a qualified higher education expense under section 529(c)(9) with respect to loans of the taxpayer as would be includible in gross income under section 529(c)(3)(A) for such taxable year but for such treatment.
   (2)
   Married couples must file joint return
   If the taxpayer is married at the close of the taxable year, the deduction shall be allowed under subsection (a) only if the taxpayer and the taxpayer’s spouse file a joint return for the taxable year.
   (3)
   Marital status
   Marital status shall be determined in accordance with section 7703.
   (f)
   Inflation adjustments
   (1)
   In general
   In the case of a taxable year beginning after 2002, the $50,000 and $100,000 amounts in subsection (b)(2) shall each be increased by an amount equal to—
   (A)
   such dollar amount, multiplied by
   (B)
   the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins, determined by substituting “calendar year 2001” for “calendar year 2016” in subparagraph (A)(ii) thereof.
   (2)
   Rounding
   If any amount as adjusted under paragraph (1) is not a multiple of $5,000, such amount shall be rounded to the next lowest multiple of $5,000.
