   Definition
   For purposes of this title—
   (1)
   General rule
   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the term “
   unrelated business taxable income
   ” means the gross income derived by any organization from any
   unrelated trade or business
   (as defined in
   section 513
   ) regularly carried on by it, less the deductions allowed by this chapter which are directly connected with the carrying on of such trade or business, both computed with the modifications provided in subsection (b).
   (2)
   Special rule for foreign organizations
   In the case of an organization described in
   section 511
   which is a foreign organization, the
   unrelated business taxable income
   shall be—
   (A)
   its
   unrelated business taxable income
   which is derived from sources within the United States and which is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, plus
   (B)
   its
   unrelated business taxable income
   which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States.
   (3)
   Special rules applicable to organizations described in paragraph (7), (9), or (17) of section 501(c)
   (A)
   General rule
   In the case of an organization described in paragraph (7), (9), or (17) of section 501(c), the term “
   unrelated business taxable income
   ” means the gross income (excluding any
   exempt function income)
   , less the deductions allowed by this chapter which are directly connected with the production of the gross income (excluding
   exempt function income)
   , both computed with the modifications provided in paragraphs (6), (10), (11), and (12) of subsection (b). For purposes of the preceding sentence, the deductions provided by sections 243 and 245 (relating to dividends received by corporations) shall be treated as not directly connected with the production of gross income.
   (B)
   Exempt function income
   For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “
   exempt function income
   ” means the gross income from
   dues,
   fees, charges, or similar amounts paid by members of the organization as consideration for providing such members or their dependents or guests goods, facilities, or services in furtherance of the purposes constituting the basis for the exemption of the organization to which such income is paid. Such term also means all income (other than an amount equal to the gross income derived from any
   unrelated trade or business
   regularly carried on by such organization computed as if the organization were subject to paragraph (1)), which is set aside—
   (i)
   for a purpose specified in section 170(c)(4), or
   (ii)
   in the case of an organization described in paragraph (9) or (17) of section 501(c), to provide for the payment of life, sick, accident, or other benefits,
   including reasonable costs of administration directly connected with a purpose described in clause (i) or (ii). If during the taxable year, an amount which is attributable to income so set aside is used for a purpose other than that described in clause (i) or (ii), such amount shall be included, under subparagraph (A), in
   unrelated business taxable income
   for the taxable year.
   (C)
   Applicability to certain corporations described in section 501(c)(2)
   In the case of a corporation described in section 501(c)(2), the income of which is payable to an organization described in paragraph (7), (9), or (17) of section 501(c), subparagraph (A) shall apply as if such corporation were the organization to which the income is payable. For purposes of the preceding sentence, such corporation shall be treated as having
   exempt function income
   for a taxable year only if it files a consolidated return with such organization for such year.
   (D)
   Nonrecognition of gain
   If property used directly in the performance of the exempt function of an organization described in paragraph (7), (9), or (17) of section 501(c) is sold by such organization, and within a period beginning 1 year before the date of such sale, and ending 3 years after such date, other property is purchased and used by such organization directly in the performance of its exempt function, gain (if any) from such sale shall be recognized only to the extent that such organization’s sales price of the old property exceeds the organization’s cost of purchasing the other property. For purposes of this subparagraph, the destruction in whole or in part, theft, seizure, requisition, or condemnation of property, shall be treated as the sale of such property, and rules similar to the rules provided by subsections (b), (c), (e), and (j) of section 1034 (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the
   Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997
   ) shall apply.
   (E)
   Limitation on amount of setaside in the case of organizations described in paragraph (9) or (17) of section 501(c)
   (i)
   In general
   In the case of any organization described in paragraph (9) or (17) of section 501(c), a set-aside for any purpose specified in clause (ii) of subparagraph (B) may be taken into account under subparagraph (B) only to the extent that such set-aside does not result in an amount of assets set aside for such purpose in excess of the account limit determined under
   section 419A
   (without regard to subsection (f)(6) thereof) for the taxable year (not taking into account any reserve described in section 419A(c)(2)(A) for post-retirement medical benefits).
   (ii)
   Treatment of existing reserves for post-retirement medical or life insurance benefits
   (I)
   Clause (i) shall not apply to any income attributable to an existing
   reserve for post-retirement medical or life insurance benefits
   .
   (II)
   For purposes of subclause (I), the term “
   reserve for post-retirement medical or life insurance benefits
   ” means the greater of the amount of assets set aside for purposes of post-retirement medical or life insurance benefits to be provided to covered employees as of the close of the last plan year ending before the date of the enactment of the
   Tax Reform Act of 1984
   or on
   July 18, 1984
   .
   (III)
   All payments during plan years ending on or after the date of the enactment of the
   Tax Reform Act of 1984
   of post-retirement medical benefits or life insurance benefits shall be charged against the reserve referred to in subclause (II). Except to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, all plans of an employer shall be treated as 1 plan for purposes of the preceding sentence.
   (iii)
   Treatment of tax exempt organizations
   This subparagraph shall not apply to any organization if substantially all of the contributions to such organization are made by employers who were exempt from tax under this chapter throughout the 5-taxable year period ending with the taxable year in which the contributions are made.
   (4)
   Special rule applicable to organizations described in section 501(c)(19)

   section 170(c)(4).
   If an amount set aside under the preceding sentence is used during the taxable year for a purpose other than a purpose described in the preceding sentence, such amount shall be included, under paragraph (1), in
   unrelated business taxable income
   for the taxable year.

   of property shall be considered as qualified if—
   (I)
   such property is transferred by the
   eligible taxpayer
   to an unrelated person, and
   (II)
   within 1 year of such transfer the
   eligible taxpayer
   has received a certification from the
   Environmental Protection Agency
   or an appropriate State agency (within the meaning of section 198(c)(4)) in the State in which such property is located that, as a result of the
   eligible taxpayer’
   s remediation actions, such property would not be treated as a
   qualifying brownfield property
   in the hands of the transferee.
   For purposes of subclause (II), before issuing such certification, the
   Environmental Protection Agency
   or appropriate State agency shall respond to comments received pursuant to clause (ii)(V) in the same form and manner as required under section 117(b) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (as in effect on the date of the enactment of this paragraph).
   (ii)

   Remedial actions which comply with all applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements (consistent with section 121(d) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980) have been substantially completed, such that there are no hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants which complicate the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of the property given the property’s reasonably anticipated future land uses or capacity for uses of the property.
   (II)
   The reasonably anticipated future land uses or capacity for uses of the property are more economically productive or environmentally beneficial than the uses of the property in existence on the date of the certification described in subparagraph (C)(i). For purposes of the preceding sentence, use of property as a landfill or other hazardous waste facility shall not be considered more economically productive or environmentally beneficial.
   (III)
   A remediation plan has been implemented to bring the property into compliance with all applicable local, State, and Federal environmental laws, regulations, and standards and to ensure that the remediation protects human health and the environment.
   (IV)

   controls
   , and financial assurances have been put in place to ensure the complete remediation of the property in accordance with the remediation plan as soon as is reasonably practicable after the sale, exchange, or other
   disposition
   of such property.
   (V)
   Public notice and the opportunity for comment on the request for certification was completed before the date of such request. Such notice and opportunity for comment shall be in the same form and manner as required for public participation required under section 117(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (as in effect on the date of the enactment of this paragraph). For purposes of this subclause, public notice shall include, at a minimum, publication in a major local newspaper of general circulation.

   (and, where applicable, of the
   qualifying partnership
   ) for the taxable year during which the transfer occurs.
   (iv)
