   For purposes of clause (i)(II), any interest in the

   insurance company
   or the preceding taxable year. For purposes of this subclause, the term

   insurance company
   for which the determination is being made, and
   (II)
   in determining the attribution of premiums to any
   policyholder
   under subparagraph (B)(i), all
   policyholders

   such dollar amount, multiplied by
   (ii)
   the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for such calendar year by substituting “calendar year 2013” for “calendar year 2016” in subparagraph (A)(ii) thereof.
   If the amount as adjusted under the preceding sentence is not a multiple of $50,000, such amount shall be rounded to the next lowest multiple of $50,000.
   (3)
   Limitation on use of net operating losses
   For purposes of this part, a net operating loss (as defined in
   section 172
   ) shall not be carried—
   (A)
   to or from any taxable year for which the
