   tax shelter farm activity
   shall be allowed.
   (B)
   Deduction in succeeding taxable year
   Any loss from a
   tax shelter farm activity
   disallowed under subparagraph (A) shall be treated as a deduction allocable to such activity in the 1st succeeding taxable year.

   Tax shelter farm activity
   For purposes of this subsection, the term “
   tax shelter farm activity
   ” means—
   (A)

   (B)
   any other activity consisting of farming which is a passive activity (within the meaning of
   section 469(c)
   ).
   (3)
   Determination of loss
   In determining the amount of the loss from any
   tax shelter farm activity

   For purposes of this section—
   (1)
   Special rule for insolvent taxpayers
   (A)

   insolvent
   as of the close of the taxable year.
   (B)
   Insolvent
   For purposes of this paragraph, the term “
   insolvent
   ” means the excess of liabilities over the fair market value of assets.
   (2)
   Loss allowed for year of disposition of farm shelter activity
   If the taxpayer disposes of his entire interest in any
   tax shelter farm activity
   during any taxable year, the amount of the loss attributable to such activity (determined after carryovers under subsection (a)(1)(B)) shall (to the extent otherwise allowable) be allowed for such taxable year in computing alternative minimum taxable income and not treated as a loss from a
   tax shelter farm activity
