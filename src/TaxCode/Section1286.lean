   (a)
   Inclusion in income as if bond and coupons were original issue discount bonds
   If any person
   purchases
   a
   stripped bond
   or a
   stripped coupon
   , then such
   bond
   or
   coupon
   while held by such purchaser (or by any other person whose basis is determined by reference to the basis in the hands of such purchaser) shall be treated for purposes of this part as a
   bond
   originally issued on the
   purchase
   date and having an
   original issue discount
   equal to the excess (if any) of—
   (1)
   the
   stated redemption price at maturity
   (or, in the case of
   coupon,
   the amount payable on the due date of such
   coupon)
   , over
   (2)
   such
   bond
   ’s or
   coupon
   ’s ratable share of the
   purchase
   price.
   For purposes of paragraph (2), ratable shares shall be determined on the basis of their respective fair market values on the date of
   purchase
   .
   (b)
   Tax treatment of person stripping bond
   For purposes of this subtitle, if any person strips 1 or more
   coupons
   from a
   bond
   and disposes of the
   bond
   or such
   coupon
   —
   (1)
   such person shall include in gross income an amount equal to the sum of—
   (A)
   the interest accrued on such
   bond
   while held by such person and before the time such
   coupon
   or
   bond
   was disposed of (to the extent such interest has not theretofore been included in such person’s gross income), and
   (B)
   the accrued
   market discount
   on such
   bond
   determined as of the time such
   coupon
   or
   bond
   was disposed of (to the extent such discount has not theretofore been included in such person’s gross income),
   (2)
   the basis of the
   bond
   and
   coupons
   shall be increased by the amount included in gross income under paragraph (1),
   (3)
   the basis of the
   bond
   and
   coupons
   immediately before the
   disposition
   (as adjusted pursuant to paragraph (2)) shall be allocated among the items retained by such person and the items disposed of by such person on the basis of their respective fair market values, and
   (4)
   for purposes of subsection (a), such person shall be treated as having purchased on the date of such
   disposition
   each such item which he retains for an amount equal to the basis allocated to such item under paragraph (3).
   A rule similar to the rule of paragraph (4) shall apply in the case of any person whose basis in any
   bond
   or
   coupon
   is determined by reference to the basis of the person described in the preceding sentence.
   (c)
   Special rules for tax-exempt obligations
   (1)
   In general
   In the case of any tax-exempt obligation (as defined in
   section 1275(a)(3)
   ) from which 1 or more
   coupons
   have been stripped—
   (A)
   the amount of the
   original issue discount
   determined under subsection (a) with respect to any
   stripped bond
   or
   stripped coupon
   —
   (i)
   shall be treated as
   original issue discount
   on a tax-exempt obligation to the extent such discount does not exceed the tax-exempt portion of such discount, and
   (ii)
   shall be treated as
   original issue discount
   on an obligation which is not a tax-exempt obligation to the extent such discount exceeds the tax-exempt portion of such discount,
   (B)
   subsection (b)(1)(A) shall not apply, and
   (C)
   subsection (b)(2) shall be applied by increasing the basis of the
   bond
   or
   coupon
   by the sum of—
   (i)
   the interest accrued but not paid before such
   bond
   or
   coupon
   was disposed of (and not previously reflected in basis), plus
   (ii)
   the amount included in gross income under subsection (b)(1)(B).
   (2)
   Tax-exempt portion
   For purposes of paragraph (1), the tax-exempt portion of the
   original issue discount
   determined under subsection (a) is the excess of—
   (A)
   the amount referred to in subsection (a)(1), over
   (B)
   an
   issue price
   which would produce a yield to maturity as of the
   purchase
   date equal to the lower of—
   (i)
   the
   coupon
   rate of interest on the obligation from which the
   coupons
   were separated, or
   (ii)
   the yield to maturity (on the basis of the
   purchase
   price) of the stripped obligation or
   coupon.
   The purchaser of any stripped obligation or
   coupon
   may elect to apply clause (i) by substituting “original yield to maturity of” for “
   coupon
   rate of interest on”.
   (d)
