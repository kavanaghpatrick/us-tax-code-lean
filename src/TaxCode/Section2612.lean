   (a)
   Taxable termination
   (1)
   General rule
   For purposes of this chapter, the term “
   taxable termination
   ” means the termination (by death, lapse of time, release of power, or otherwise) of an interest in property held in a trust unless—
   (A)
   immediately after such termination, a
   non-skip person
   has an interest in such property, or
   (B)
   at no time after such termination may a distribution (including distributions on termination) be made from such trust to a
   skip person
   .
   (2)
   Certain partial terminations treated as taxable
   If, upon the termination of an interest in property held in trust by reason of the death of a lineal descendant of the transferor, a specified portion of the trust’s assets are distributed to 1 or more
   skip persons
   (or 1 or more trusts for the exclusive benefit of such persons), such termination shall constitute a
   taxable termination
   with respect to such portion of the trust property.
   (b)
   Taxable distribution
   For purposes of this chapter, the term “
   taxable distribution
   ” means any distribution from a trust to a
   skip person
   (other than a
   taxable termination
   or a
   direct skip)
   .
   (c)
   Direct skip
   For purposes of this chapter—
   (1)
   In general
   The term “
   direct skip
   ” means a transfer subject to a tax imposed by chapter 11 or 12 of an interest in property to a
   skip person
   .
   (2)

   Solely for purposes of determining whether any transfer to a trust is a

   direct skip,
   if—
   “(A) an individual is a grandchild of the transferor (or the transferor’s spouse or former spouse), and
   “(B) as of the time of the transfer, the parent of such individual who is a lineal descendant of the transferor (or the transferor’s spouse or former spouse) is dead,
   such individual shall be treated as if such individual were a child of the transferor and all of that grandchild’s children shall be treated as if they were grandchildren of the transferor. In the case of lineal descendants below a grandchild, the preceding sentence may be reapplied. If any transfer of property to a trust would be a
   direct skip
   but for this paragraph, any generation assignment under this paragraph shall apply also for purposes of applying this chapter to transfers from the portion of the trust attributable to such property.”
   Subsec. (c)(3).

   skip persons
   who are lineal descendants of the holder of such interest (or to 1 or more trusts for the exclusive benefit of such persons), such termination shall constitute a
   taxable termination
   with respect to such portion of the trust property.”
   Subsec. (c)(2).
   Pub. L. 100–647, § 1014(g)(7)
   , in closing provisions, inserted at end “If any transfer of property to a trust would be a

   for former provisions which indicated who the “deemed transferor” would be for purposes of this chapter and that, for purposes of determining the person deemed the transferor, a parent related to the grantor of a trust by blood or adoption was to be deemed more closely related than a parent related to a grantor by marriage.
