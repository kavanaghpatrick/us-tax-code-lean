   (a)
   Exclusion from gross income
   (1)
   In general
   Gross income of an
   employee
   does not include amounts paid or expenses incurred by the employer for
   educational assistance
   to the
   employee
   if the assistance is furnished pursuant to a program which is described in subsection (b).
   (2)
   $5,250 maximum exclusion
   If, but for this paragraph, this section would exclude from gross income more than $5,250 of
   educational assistance
   furnished to an individual during a calendar year, this section shall apply only to the first $5,250 of such assistance so furnished.
   (b)
   Educational assistance program
   (1)
   In general
   For purposes of this section an
   educational assistance
   program is a separate written plan of an employer for the exclusive benefit of his
   employees
   to provide such
   employees
   with
   educational assistance
   . The program must meet the requirements of paragraphs (2) through (6) of this subsection.
   (2)
   Eligibility
   The program shall benefit
   employees
   who qualify under a classification set up by the employer and found by the Secretary not to be discriminatory in favor of
   employees
   who are highly compensated
   employees
   (within the meaning of
   section 414(q)
   ) or their dependents. For purposes of this paragraph, there shall be excluded from consideration
   employees
   not included in the program who are included in a unit of
   employees
   covered by an agreement which the Secretary of Labor finds to be a collective bargaining agreement between
   employee
   representatives and one or more employers, if there is evidence that
   educational assistance
   benefits were the subject of good faith bargaining between such
   employee
   representatives and such employer or employers.
   (3)
   Principal shareholders or owners
   Not more than 5 percent of the amounts paid or incurred by the employer for
   educational assistance
   during the year may be provided for the class of individuals who are shareholders or owners (or their spouses or dependents), each of whom (on any day of the year) owns more than 5 percent of the stock or of the capital or profits interest in the employer.
   (4)
   Other benefits as an alternative
   A program must not provide eligible
   employees
   with a choice between
   educational assistance
   and other remuneration includible in gross income. For purposes of this section, the business practices of the employer (as well as the written program) will be taken into account.
   (5)
   No funding required
   A program referred to in paragraph (1) is not required to be funded.
   (6)
   Notification of employees
   Reasonable notification of the availability and terms of the program must be provided to eligible
   employees
   .
   (c)
   Definitions; special rules
   For purposes of this section—
   (1)
   Educational assistance
   The term “
   educational assistance
   ” means—
   (A)

   employee
   for education of the
   employee
   (including, but not limited to, tuition, fees, and similar payments, books, supplies, and equipment),
   (B)
   the payment by an employer, whether paid to the
   employee
   or to a lender, of principal or interest on any qualified education loan (as defined in section 221(d)(1)) incurred by the
   employee
   for education of the
   employee
   , and
   (C)
   the provision, by an employer, of courses of instruction for such
   employee
   (including books, supplies, and equipment),
   but does not include payment for, or the provision of, tools or supplies which may be retained by the
   employee
   after completion of a course of instruction, or meals, lodging, or transportation. The term “
   educational assistance
   ” also does not include any payment for, or the provision of any benefits with respect to, any course or other education involving sports, games, or hobbies.
   (2)
   Employee
   The term “
   employee
   ” includes, for any year, an individual who is an
   employee
   within the meaning of section 401(c)(1) (relating to self-employed individuals).
   (3)
   Employer
   An individual who owns the entire interest in an unincorporated trade or business shall be treated as his own employer. A partnership shall be treated as the employer of each partner who is an
   employee
   within the meaning of paragraph (2).
   (4)
   Attribution rules
   (A)
   Ownership of stock
   Ownership of stock in a corporation shall be determined in accordance with the rules provided under subsections (d) and (e) of
   section 1563
   (without regard to section 1563(e)(3)(C)).
   (B)
   Interest in unincorporated trade or business
   The interest of an
   employee
   in a trade or business which is not incorporated shall be determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, which shall be based on principles similar to the principles which apply in the case of subparagraph (A).
   (5)
   Certain tests not applicable
   An
   educational assistance
   program shall not be held or considered to fail to meet any requirements of subsection (b) merely because—
   (A)
   of utilization rates for the different types of
   educational assistance
   made available under the program; or
   (B)
   successful completion, or attaining a particular course grade, is required for or considered in determining reimbursement under the program.
   (6)
   Relationship to current law
   This section shall not be construed to affect the deduction or inclusion in income of amounts (not within the exclusion under this section) which are paid or incurred, or received as reimbursement, for educational expenses under section
   117
   ,
   162
   or 212.
   (7)
   Disallowance of excluded amounts as credit or deduction
   No deduction or credit shall be allowed to the
   employee
   under any other section of this chapter for any amount excluded from income by reason of this section.
   (d)
   Inflation adjustment
   (1)
   In general
   In the case of any taxable year beginning after 2026, both of the $5,250 amounts in subsection (a)(2) shall each be increased by an amount equal to—
   (A)
   such dollar amount, multiplied by
   (B)
   the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins, determined by substituting “calendar year 2025” for “calendar year 2016” in subparagraph (A)(ii) thereof.
   (2)
   Rounding
   If any increase under paragraph (1) is not a multiple of $50, such increase shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $50.
   (e)
