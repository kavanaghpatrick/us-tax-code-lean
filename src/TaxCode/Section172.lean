   (I)
   Special election to exclude
   section 965
   years
   If the 5-year carryback period under clause (i)(I) with respect to any
   net operating loss
   of a taxpayer includes 1 or more taxable years in which an amount is includible in gross income by reason of section 965(a), the taxpayer may, in lieu of the election otherwise available under paragraph (3), elect under such paragraph to exclude all such taxable years from such carryback period.
   (II)

   An election under paragraph (3) (including an election described in subclause (I)) with respect to a

   (2)
   Amount of carrybacks and carryovers
   The entire amount of the
   net operating loss
   for any taxable year (hereinafter in this section referred to as the
   “loss year”
   ) shall be carried to the earliest of the taxable years to which (by reason of paragraph (1)) such loss may be carried. The portion of such loss which shall be carried to each of the other taxable years shall be the excess, if any, of the amount of such loss over the sum of the taxable income for each of the prior taxable years to which such loss may be carried. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the taxable income for any such prior taxable year shall—
   (A)
   be computed with the modifications specified in subsection (d) other than paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) thereof, and by determining the amount of the
   net operating loss

   for the
   loss year

   net operating loss
   for which the election is to be in effect. Such election, once made for any taxable year, shall be irrevocable for such taxable year.
   (c)
   Net operating loss defined
   For purposes of this section, the term “
   net operating loss
   ” means the excess of the deductions allowed by this chapter over the gross income. Such excess shall be computed with the modifications specified in subsection (d).
