   Distributee taxable under section 72
   If an annuity contract is purchased by an employer for an
   employee
   under a plan which meets the requirements of section 404(a)(2) (whether or not the employer deducts the amounts paid for the contract under such section), the amount actually distributed to any distributee under the contract shall be taxable to the distributee (in the year in which so distributed) under section 72 (relating to annuities).
   (2)
   Special rule for health and long-term care insurance
   To the extent provided in section 402(l), paragraph (1) shall not apply to the amount distributed under the contract which is otherwise includible in gross income under this subsection.
   (3)
   Self-employed individuals
   For purposes of this subsection, the term “
   employee
   ” includes an individual who is an
   employee
   within the meaning of section 401(c)(1), and the employer of such individual is the person treated as his employer under section 401(c)(4).
   (4)
   Rollover amounts
   (A)
   General rule
   If—
   (i)

   ),
   (ii)
   the
   employee
   transfers any portion of the property he receives in such distribution to an eligible retirement plan, and
   (iii)
   in the case of a distribution of property other than money, the amount so transferred consists of the property distributed,
   then such distribution (to the extent so transferred) shall not be includible in gross income for the taxable year in which paid.
   (B)

   shall not be includible in gross income for the taxable year of such transfer.
   (6)
   Qualified long-term care distributions

   (A)
   an annuity contract is purchased—
   (i)
   for an
   employee
   by an employer described in
   section 501(c)(3)
   which is exempt from tax under section 501(a),
   (ii)
   for an
   employee
   (other than an
   employee
   described in clause (i)), who performs services for an educational organization described in section 170(b)(1) (A)(ii), by an employer which is a State, a political subdivision of a State, or an agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or

   employee
   for the taxable year to the extent that the aggregate of such contributions and additions (when expressed as an annual addition (within the meaning of section 415(c)(2))) does not exceed the applicable limit under section 415. The amount actually distributed to any distributee under such contract shall be taxable to the distributee (in the year in which so distributed) under section 72 (relating to annuities). For purposes of applying the rules of this subsection to contributions and other additions by an employer for a taxable year, amounts transferred to a contract described in this paragraph by reason of a rollover contribution described in paragraph (8) of this subsection or section 408(d)(3)(A)(ii) shall not be considered contributed by such employer.

   any amount which is contributed or deferred by the employer at the election of the
   employee
   and which is not includible in the gross income of the
   employee
   by reason of section 125, 132(f)(4), or 457.
   (4)
   Years of service
   In determining the number of years of service for purposes of this subsection, there shall be included—

   employee

   (12)
   Nondiscrimination requirements
   (A)
   In general

   section 410(b)
   in the same manner as if such plan were described in section 401(a), and
   (ii)
   all
   employees
   of the organization may elect to have the employer make contributions of more than $200 pursuant to a salary reduction agreement if any
   employee
   of the organization may elect to have the organization make contributions for such contracts pursuant to such agreement.
   For purposes of clause (i), a contribution shall be treated as not made pursuant to a salary reduction agreement if under the agreement it is made pursuant to a 1-time irrevocable election made by the
   employee
   at the time of initial eligibility to participate in the agreement or is made pursuant to a similar arrangement involving a one-time irrevocable election specified in regulations. For purposes of clause (ii), there may be excluded any
   employee
   who is a participant in an eligible deferred compensation plan (within the meaning of section 457) or a qualified cash or deferred arrangement of the organization or another annuity contract described in this subsection. Any nonresident alien described in section 410(b)(3)(C) may also be excluded. Subject to the conditions applicable under section 410(b)(4) and section 202(c) of the
   Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
   , there may be excluded for purposes of this subparagraph
   employees
   who are students performing services described in section 3121(b)(10) and
   employees
   who normally work less than 20 hours per week. The fact that the employer offers
   matching contributions
   on account of qualified student loan payments as described in section 401(m)(13) shall not be taken into account in determining whether the arrangement satisfies the requirements of clause (ii) (and any regulation thereunder). A plan shall not fail to satisfy clause (ii) solely by reason of offering a de minimis financial incentive (not derived from plan assets) to
   employees
   to elect to have the employer make contributions pursuant to a salary reduction agreement.
   (B)

   employees
   eligible to participate in the plan, and
   (II)

   No amount shall be includible in gross income by reason of a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to a defined benefit
   governmental plan

   (B)
   Treatment of employers failing to meet requirements of plan
   (i)
   In general
   In the case of a plan maintained by more than 1 employer, this subsection shall not be treated as failing to apply to an annuity contract held under such plan merely because of one or more employers failing to meet the requirements of this subsection if such plan satisfies rules similar to the rules of
   section 413(e)(2)
   with respect to any such employer failure.
   (ii)
