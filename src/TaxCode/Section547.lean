   | next
   (a)
   General rule
   If a
   determination
   (as defined in subsection (c)) with respect to a taxpayer establishes liability for
   personal holding company
   tax imposed by
   section 541
   (or by a corresponding provision of a prior income tax law) for any taxable year, a deduction shall be allowed to the taxpayer for the amount of
   deficiency dividends
   (as defined in subsection (d)) for the purpose of determining the
   personal holding company
   tax for such year, but not for the purpose of determining interest, additional amounts, or assessable penalties computed with respect to such
   personal holding company
   tax.
   (b)
   Rules for application of section
   (1)
   Allowance of deduction
   The deficiency dividend deduction shall be allowed as of the date the claim for the deficiency dividend deduction is filed.
   (2)
   Credit or refund
   If the allowance of a deficiency dividend deduction results in an overpayment of
   personal holding company
   tax for any taxable year, credit or refund with respect to such overpayment shall be made as if on the date of the
   determination
   2 years remained before the expiration of the period of limitation on the filing of claim for refund for the taxable year to which the overpayment relates. No interest shall be allowed on a credit or refund arising from the application of this section.
   (c)
   Determination
   For purposes of this section, the term “
   determination
   ” means—
   (1)
   a decision by the Tax Court or a judgment, decree, or other order by any court of competent jurisdiction, which has become final;
   (2)
   a closing agreement made under section 7121; or
   (3)
   under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, an agreement signed by the Secretary and by, or on behalf of, the taxpayer relating to the liability of such taxpayer for
   personal holding company
   tax.
   (d)
   Deficiency dividends
   (1)
   Definition
   For purposes of this section, the term “
   deficiency dividends
   ” means the amount of the dividends paid by the corporation on or after the date of the
   determination
   and before filing claim under subsection (e), which would have been includible in the computation of the deduction for dividends paid under
   section 561
   for the taxable year with respect to which the liability for
   personal holding company
   tax exists, if distributed during such taxable year. No dividends shall be considered as
   deficiency dividends
   for purposes of subsection (a) unless distributed within 90 days after the
   determination.
   (2)
   Effect on dividends paid deduction
   (A)
   For taxable year in which paid
   Deficiency dividends paid in any taxable year (to the extent of the portion thereof taken into account under subsection (a) in determining
   personal holding company
   tax) shall not be included in the amount of dividends paid for such year for purposes of computing the dividends paid deduction for such year and succeeding years.
   (B)
   For prior taxable year
   Deficiency dividends paid in any taxable year (to the extent of the portion thereof taken into account under subsection (a) in determining
   personal holding company
   tax) shall not be allowed for purposes of section 563(b) in the computation of the dividends paid deduction for the taxable year preceding the taxable year in which paid.
   (e)
   Claim required
   No deficiency dividend deduction shall be allowed under subsection (a) unless (under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) claim therefor is filed within 120 days after the
   determination
   .
   (f)
   Suspension of statute of limitations and stay of collection
   (1)
   Suspension of running of statute
   If the corporation files a claim, as provided in subsection (e), the running of the statute of limitations provided in section 6501 on the making of assessments, and the bringing of distraint or a proceeding in court for collection, in respect of the deficiency and all interest, additional amounts, or assessable penalties, shall be suspended for a period of 2 years after the date of the
   determination
   .
   (2)
   Stay of collection
   In the case of any deficiency with respect to the tax imposed by
   section 541
   established by a
   determination
   under this section—
   (A)
   the collection of the deficiency and all interest, additional amounts, and assessable penalties shall, except in cases of jeopardy, be stayed until the expiration of 120 days after the date of the
   determination
   , and
   (B)
   if claim for deficiency dividend deduction is filed under subsection (e), the collection of such part of the deficiency as is not reduced by the deduction for
   deficiency dividends
   provided in subsection (a) shall be stayed until the date the claim is disallowed (in whole or in part) and if disallowed in part collection shall be made only with respect to the part disallowed.
   No distraint or proceeding in court shall be begun for the collection of an amount the collection of which is stayed under subparagraph (A) or (B) during the period for which the collection of such amount is stayed.
   (g)
   Deduction denied in case of fraud, etc.
   No deficiency dividend deduction shall be allowed under subsection (a) if the
   determination
   contains a finding that any part of the deficiency is due to fraud with intent to evade tax, or to wilful failure to file an income tax return within the time prescribed by law or prescribed by the Secretary in pursuance of law.
