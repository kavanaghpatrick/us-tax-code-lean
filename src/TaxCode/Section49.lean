   If, at the close of a taxable year following the taxable year in which the property was placed in service, there is a net decrease in the amount of

   disposition
   or cessation rules under section 50(a), any increase in a taxpayer’s

   nonqualified nonrecourse financing
   (within the meaning of subsection (a)(1)) with respect to any property to which subsection (a)(1) applied, then the tax under this chapter for such taxable year shall be increased by an amount equal to the aggregate decrease in credits allowed under section 38 for all prior taxable years which would have resulted from reducing the
   credit base
   (as defined in subsection (a)(1)(C)) taken into account with respect to such property by the amount of such net increase. For purposes of determining the amount of credit subject to the early
   disposition
   or cessation rules of section 50(a), the net increase in the amount of the
   nonqualified nonrecourse financing
   with respect to the property shall be treated as reducing the property’s
   credit base
   in the year in which the property was first placed in service.
   (2)
   Transfers of debt more than 1 year after initial borrowing not treated as increasing nonqualified nonrecourse financing
   For purposes of paragraph (1), the amount of
   nonqualified nonrecourse financing
   (within the meaning of subsection (a)(1)(D)) with respect to the taxpayer shall not be treated as increased by reason of a transfer of (or agreement to transfer) any evidence of any indebtedness if such transfer occurs (or such agreement is entered into) more than 1 year after the date such indebtedness was incurred.
   (3)
   Special rules for certain energy property
   Rules similar to the rules of section 47(d)(3) (as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the
   Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990
   ) shall apply for purposes of this subsection.
   (4)
   Special rule
   Any increase in tax under paragraph (1) shall not be treated as tax imposed by this chapter for purposes of determining the amount of any credit allowable under this chapter.
