   General rule
   (1)
   In general
   No gain or loss shall be recognized if stock or

   (ii)
   any such
   securities
   are received and no such
   securities
   are surrendered.
   (B)
   Property attributable to accrued interest
   Neither paragraph (1) nor so much of section 356 as relates to paragraph (1) shall apply to the extent that any stock (including nonqualified preferred stock, as defined in section 351(g)(2)),

   (i)
   In general
   Nonqualified preferred stock (as defined in

   (III)
   Extension of statute of limitations
   The statutory period for the assessment of any deficiency attributable to a corporation failing to be a
   family-owned corporation
   shall not expire before the expiration of 3 years after the date the Secretary is notified by the corporation (in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe) of such failure, and such deficiency may be assessed before the expiration of such 3-year period notwithstanding the provisions of any other law or rule of law which would otherwise prevent such assessment.
