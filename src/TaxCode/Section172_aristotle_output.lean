   If a
   net operating loss
   of a taxpayer is carried pursuant to clause (i)(I) to any taxable year in which an amount is includible in gross income by reason of section 965(a), the taxpayer shall be treated as having made the election under
   section 965(n)
   with respect to each such taxable year.
   (v)
   Special rules for elections under paragraph (3)
   (I)
   Special election to exclude
   section 965
   years
   If the 5-year carryback period under clause (i)(I) with respect to any
   net operating loss
   of a taxpayer includes 1 or more taxable years in which an amount is includible in gross income by reason of section 965(a), the taxpayer may, in lieu of the election otherwise available under paragraph (3), elect under such paragraph to exclude all such taxable years from such carryback period.
   (II)
   Time of elections
   An election under paragraph (3) (including an election described in subclause (I)) with respect to a
   net operating loss
   arising in a taxable year beginning in 2018 or 2019 shall be made by the due date (including extensions of time) for filing the taxpayer’s return for the first taxable year ending after the date of the enactment of this subparagraph.
   (2)
   Amount of carrybacks and carryovers
   The entire amount of the
   net operating loss
   for any taxable year (hereinafter in this section referred to as the
   “loss year”
   ) shall be carried to the earliest of the taxable years to which (by reason of paragraph (1)) such loss may be carried. The portion of such loss which shall be carried to each of the other taxable years shall be the excess, if any, of the amount of such loss over the sum of the taxable income for each of the prior taxable years to which such loss may be carried. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the taxable income for any such prior taxable year shall—
   (A)
   be computed with the modifications specified in subsection (d) other than paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) thereof, and by determining the amount of the
   net operating loss
   deduction without regard to the
   net operating loss
   for the
   loss year
   or for any taxable year thereafter,
   (B)
   not be considered to be less than zero, and
   (C)

   (3)
   Election to waive carryback
   Any taxpayer entitled to a carryback period under paragraph (1) may elect to relinquish the entire carryback period with respect to a
   net operating loss
   for any taxable year. Such election shall be made in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary, and shall be made by the due date (including extensions of time) for filing the taxpayer’s return for the taxable year of the
   net operating loss
   for which the election is to be in effect. Such election, once made for any taxable year, shall be irrevocable for such taxable year.
   (c)
   Net operating loss defined
   For purposes of this section, the term “
   net operating loss
   ” means the excess of the deductions allowed by this chapter over the gross income. Such excess shall be computed with the modifications specified in subsection (d).
   (d)

   The modifications referred to in this section are as follows:
   (1)
   Net operating loss deduction

   In the case of a taxpayer other than a corporation, the deductions allowable by this chapter which are not attributable to a taxpayer’s trade or business shall be allowed only to the extent of the amount of the gross income not derived from such trade or business. For purposes of the preceding sentence—
   (A)
   any gain or loss from the sale or other
   disposition

   (i)
   property, used in the trade or business, of a character which is subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section 167, or
   (ii)
   real property used in the trade or business,
   shall be treated as attributable to the trade or business;

   (B)
   where such taxable year is a “prior taxable year” referred to in paragraph (2) of subsection (b), the term “taxable income” in such paragraph shall mean “real estate investment trust taxable income” (as defined in
   section 857(b)(2)
