   on or after the date of the
   determination

   section 561
   for the taxable year with respect to which the liability for tax resulting from the
   determination
   exists if distributed during such taxable year. No distribution of property shall be considered as
   deficiency dividends

   determination,

   (2)

   qualified investment entity
   for the taxable year with respect to which the liability for tax resulting from the
   determination
   exists shall not exceed the sum of—
   (i)
   the excess of the amount of increase referred to in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (d) (whichever applies) over the amount of any increase in the deduction for dividends paid (computed without regard to capital gain dividends) for such taxable year which results from such
   determination

   determination
   exists shall not exceed the amount by which (i) the increase referred to in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (d) (whichever applies), exceeds (ii) the amount of any dividends paid during such taxable year which are designated or reported (as the case may be) as capital gain dividends after such
   determination.
   (3)
   Effect on dividends paid deduction
   (A)
   For taxable year in which paid
   Deficiency dividends paid in any taxable year shall not be included in the amount of dividends paid for such year for purposes of computing the dividends paid deduction for such year.
   (B)
   For prior taxable year
   Deficiency dividends paid in any taxable year shall not be allowed for purposes of section 855(a) or 858(a) in the computation of the dividends paid deduction for the taxable year preceding the taxable year in which paid.

   Claim required
   No deficiency dividend deduction shall be allowed under subsection (a) unless (under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) claim therefore is filed within 120 days after the date of the
   determination
   .
   (h)
   Suspension of statute of limitations and stay of collection
   (1)
   Suspension of running of statute

   determination.
   (2)
   Stay of collection
   In the case of any deficiency established by a
   determination
   under this section—
   (A)
   the collection of the deficiency, and all interest, additions to tax, additional amounts, and assessable penalties in respect thereof, shall, except in cases of jeopardy, be stayed until the expiration of 120 days after the date of the
   determination
   , and
   (B)
   if claim for a deficiency dividend deduction is filed under subsection (g), the collection of such part of the deficiency as is not reduced by the deduction for
   deficiency dividends
   provided in subsection (a) shall be stayed until the date the claim is disallowed (in whole or in part), and if disallowed in part collection shall be made only with respect to the part disallowed.
   No distraint or proceeding in court shall be begun for the collection of an amount the collection of which is stayed under subparagraph (A) or (B) during the period for which the collection of such amount is stayed.
   (i)
   Deduction denied in case of fraud
   No deficiency dividend deduction shall be allowed under subsection (a) if the
   determination
   contains a finding that any part of any deficiency attributable to an
   adjustment
   with respect to the taxable year is due to fraud with intent to evade tax or to willful failure to file an income tax return within the time prescribed by law or prescribed by the Secretary in pursuance of law.
