   (a)
   Application of subsection (b)
   Subsection (b) applies to—
   (1)
   a plan maintained pursuant to an agreement which the Secretary of Labor finds to be a collective-bargaining agreement between employee representatives and one or more employers, and
   (2)
   each trust which is a part of such plan.
   (b)
   General rule
   If this subsection applies to a plan, notwithstanding any other provision of this title—
   (1)
   Participation
   Section 410 shall be applied as if all employees of each of the employers who are parties to the collective-bargaining agreement and who are subject to the same benefit computation formula under the plan were employed by a single employer.
   (2)
   Discrimination, etc.
   Sections
   401(a)(4)
   and
   411(d)(3)
   shall be applied as if all participants who are subject to the same benefit computation formula and who are employed by employers who are parties to the collective bargaining agreement were employed by a single employer.
   (3)
   Exclusive benefit
   For purposes of section 401(a), in determining whether the plan of an employer is for the exclusive benefit of his employees and their beneficiaries, all plan participants shall be considered to be his employees.
   (4)
   Vesting
   Section 411
   (other than subsection (d)(3)) shall be applied as if all employers who have been parties to the collective-bargaining agreement constituted a single employer, except that the application of any rules with respect to breaks in service shall be made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor.
   (5)
   Funding
   The minimum funding standard provided by
   section 412
   shall be determined as if all participants in the plan were employed by a single employer.
   (6)
   Liability for funding tax
   For a plan year the liability under section 4971 of each employer who is a party to the collective bargaining agreement shall be determined in a reasonable manner not inconsistent with regulations prescribed by the Secretary—
   (A)
   first on the basis of their respective delinquencies in meeting required employer contributions under the plan, and
   (B)
   then on the basis of their respective liabilities for contributions under the plan.
   For purposes of this subsection and section 4971(e), an employer’s withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E of title IV of the
   Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
   shall not be treated as a liability for contributions under the plan.
   (7)
   Deduction limitations
   Each applicable limitation provided by
   section 404(a)
   shall be determined as if all participants in the plan were employed by a single employer. The amounts contributed to or under the plan by each employer who is a party to the agreement, for the portion of his taxable year which is included within such a plan year, shall be considered not to exceed such a limitation if the anticipated employer contributions for such plan year (determined in a manner consistent with the manner in which actual employer contributions for such plan year are determined) do not exceed such limitation.

   401(a)(4)
   and
   410
   with respect to such employees.
   (9)

   (c)
   Plans maintained by more than one employer
   In the case of a plan maintained by more than one employer—
   (1)

   (2)
   Exclusive benefit
   For purposes of sections 401(a) and 408(c), in determining whether the plan of an employer is for the exclusive benefit of his employees and their beneficiaries all plan participants shall be considered to be his employees.

   Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988
   to have the provisions of subparagraph (A) apply. An election under the preceding sentence shall take effect for the plan year in which made and, once made, may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary.

   (B)
   in the case of a plan not described in subparagraph (A), has a
   pooled plan provider
   ,
   then the plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements under this title applicable to a plan described in
   section 401(a)
   or to a plan that consists of individual retirement accounts described in section 408 (including by reason of subsection (c) thereof), whichever is applicable, merely because one or more employers of employees covered by the plan fail to take such actions as are required of such employers for the plan to meet such requirements.
   (2)
   Limitations
   (A)
   In general
   Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any plan unless the terms of the plan provide that in the case of any employer in the plan failing to take the actions described in paragraph (1)—
   (i)
   the assets of the plan attributable to employees of such employer (or beneficiaries of such employees) will be transferred to a plan maintained only by such employer (or its successor), to an eligible retirement plan as defined in section 402(c)(8)(B) for each individual whose account is transferred, or to any other arrangement that the Secretary determines is appropriate, unless the Secretary determines it is in the best interests of the employees of such employer (and the beneficiaries of such employees) to retain the assets in the plan, and
   (ii)
   such employer (and not the plan with respect to which the failure occurred or any other employer in such plan) shall, except to the extent provided by the Secretary, be liable for any liabilities with respect to such plan attributable to employees of such employer (or beneficiaries of such employees).
   (B)
   Failures by pooled plan providers
   If the
   pooled plan provider
   of a plan described in paragraph (1)(B) does not perform substantially all of the administrative duties which are required of the provider under paragraph (3)(A)(i) for any plan year, the Secretary may provide that the determination as to whether the plan meets the requirements under this title applicable to a plan described in
   section 401(a)
   or to a plan that consists of individual retirement accounts described in section 408 (including by reason of subsection (c) thereof), whichever is applicable, shall be made in the same manner as would be made without regard to paragraph (1).
   (3)
   Pooled plan provider
   (A)
   In general
   For purposes of this subsection, the term “
   pooled plan provider
   ” means, with respect to any plan, a person who—
   (i)
   is designated by the terms of the plan as a named fiduciary (within the meaning of section 402(a)(2) of the
   Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
   ), as the
   plan administrator,
   and as the person responsible to perform all administrative duties (including conducting proper testing with respect to the plan and the employees of each employer in the plan) which are reasonably necessary to ensure that—
   (I)
   the plan meets any requirement applicable under the
   Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
   or this title to a plan described in
   section 401(a)
   or to a plan that consists of individual retirement accounts described in section 408 (including by reason of subsection (c) thereof), whichever is applicable, and
   (II)
   each employer in the plan takes such actions as the Secretary or such person determines are necessary for the plan to meet the requirements described in subclause (I), including providing to such person any disclosures or other information which the Secretary may require or which such person otherwise determines are necessary to administer the plan or to allow the plan to meet such requirements,
   (ii)

   pooled plan provider
   with the Secretary, and provides such other information to the Secretary as the Secretary may require, before beginning operations as a
   pooled plan provider
   ,
   (iii)
   acknowledges in writing that such person is a named fiduciary (within the meaning of section 402(a)(2) of the
   Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
   ), and the
   plan administrator,
   with respect to the plan, and

   Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974

   Audits, examinations and investigations
   The Secretary may perform audits, examinations, and investigations of
   pooled plan providers
   as may be necessary to enforce and carry out the purposes of this subsection.
   (C)
   Aggregation rules
   For purposes of this paragraph, in determining whether a person meets the requirements of this paragraph to be a
   pooled plan provider
   with respect to any plan, all persons who perform services for the plan and who are treated as a single employer under subsection (b), (c), (m), or (o) of
   section 414
   shall be treated as one person.
   (D)
   Treatment of employers as plan sponsors
   Except with respect to the administrative duties of the
   pooled plan provider
   described in subparagraph (A)(i), each employer in a plan which has a
   pooled plan provider
   shall be treated as the plan sponsor with respect to the portion of the plan attributable to employees of such employer (or beneficiaries of such employees).
   (4)
   Guidance
   (A)
   In general
   The Secretary shall issue such guidance as the Secretary determines appropriate to carry out this subsection, including guidance—
   (i)
   to identify the administrative duties and other actions required to be performed by a
   pooled plan provider
   under this subsection,
   (ii)
   which describes the procedures to be taken to terminate a plan which fails to meet the requirements to be a plan described in paragraph (1), including the proper treatment of, and actions needed to be taken by, any employer in the plan and the assets and liabilities of the plan attributable to employees of such employer (or beneficiaries of such employees), and
   (iii)
   identifying appropriate cases to which the rules of paragraph (2)(A) will apply to employers in the plan failing to take the actions described in paragraph (1).
   The Secretary shall take into account under clause (iii) whether the failure of an employer or
   pooled plan provider
   to provide any disclosures or other information, or to take any other action, necessary to administer a plan or to allow a plan to meet requirements applicable to the plan under
   section 401(a)
   or 408, whichever is applicable, has continued over a period of time that demonstrates a lack of commitment to compliance.
   (B)
   Good faith compliance with law before guidance
   An employer or
   pooled plan provider
   shall not be treated as failing to meet a requirement of guidance issued by the Secretary under this paragraph if, before the issuance of such guidance, the employer or
   pooled plan provider
   complies in good faith with a reasonable interpretation of the provisions of this subsection to which such guidance relates.
   (5)
   Model plan
   The Secretary shall publish model plan language which meets the requirements of this subsection and of paragraphs (43) and (44) of section 3 of the
   Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
