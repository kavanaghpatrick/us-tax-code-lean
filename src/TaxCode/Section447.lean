   (a)
   General rule
   Except as otherwise provided by law, the taxable income from farming of—
   (1)
   a corporation engaged in the trade or business of farming, or
   (2)
   a partnership engaged in the trade or business of farming, if a corporation is a partner in such partnership,
   shall be computed on an accrual method of accounting. This section shall not apply to the trade or business of operating a nursery or sod farm or to the raising or harvesting of trees (other than fruit and nut trees).
   (b)
   Preproductive period expenses
   For rules requiring capitalization of certain preproductive period expenses, see section 263A.
   (c)
   Exception for certain corporations
   For purposes of subsection (a), a corporation shall be treated as not being a corporation for any taxable year if it is—
   (1)
   an S corporation, or
   (2)
   a corporation which meets the gross receipts test of
   section 448(c)
   for such taxable year.
   (d)
   Coordination with section 481
   Any change in method of accounting made pursuant to this section shall be treated for purposes of section 481 as initiated by the taxpayer and made with the consent of the Secretary.
   (e)
   Certain annual accrual accounting methods
   (1)
   In general
   Notwithstanding subsection (a) or section 263A, if—
   (A)
   for its 10 taxable years ending with its first taxable year beginning after
   December 31, 1975
   , a corporation or
   qualified partnership
   used an
   annual accrual method of accounting
   with respect to its trade or business of farming,
   (B)
   such corporation or
   qualified partnership
   raises crops which are harvested not less than 12 months after planting, and
   (C)
   such corporation or
   qualified partnership
   has used such method of accounting for all taxable years intervening between its first taxable year beginning after
   December 31, 1975
   , and the taxable year,
   such corporation or
   qualified partnership
   may continue to employ such method of accounting for the taxable year with respect to its
   qualified farming trade or business
   .
   (2)
   Annual accrual method of accounting defined
   For purposes of paragraph (1), the term “
   annual accrual method of accounting
   ” means a method under which revenues, costs, and expenses are computed on an accrual method of accounting and the preproductive period expenses incurred during the taxable year are charged to harvested crops or deducted in determining the taxable income for such years.
   (3)
   Certain nonrecognition transfers
   For purposes of this subsection, if—
   (A)
   a corporation acquired substantially all the assets of a
   qualified farming trade or business
   from another corporation in a transaction in which no gain or loss was recognized to the transferor or transferee corporation, or
   (B)
   a
   qualified partnership
   acquired substantially all the assets of a
   qualified farming trade or business
   from one of its partners in a transaction to which
   section 721
   applies,
   the transferee corporation or
   qualified partnership
   shall be deemed to have computed its taxable income on an
   annual accrual method of accounting
   during the period for which the transferor corporation or partnership computed its taxable income from such trade or business on an annual accrual method.
   (4)
   Qualified partnership defined
   For purposes of this subsection—
   (A)
   Qualified partnership
   The term “
   qualified partnership
   ” means a partnership which is engaged in a
   qualified farming trade or business
   and each of the partners of which is a corporation other than—
   (i)
   an S corporation, or
   (ii)
   a personal holding company (within the meaning of
   section 542(a)
   ).
   (B)
   Qualified farming trade or business
   (i)
   In general
   The term “
   qualified farming trade or business
   ” means the trade or business of farming—
   (I)
   sugar cane,
   (II)
   any plant with a preproductive period (as defined in section 263A(e)(3)) of 2 years or less, and
   (III)
   any other plant (other than any citrus or almond tree) if an election by the corporation under this subparagraph is in effect.
   In the case of a partnership and for purposes of paragraph (3)(A), subclauses (II) and (III) shall not apply.
   (ii)
   Effect of election
   For purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 263A(e), any election under this subparagraph shall be treated as if it were an election under subsection (d)(3) of section 263A.
   (iii)
   Election
   Unless the Secretary otherwise consents, an election under this subparagraph may be made only for the corporation’s 1st taxable year which begins after
   December 31, 1986
   , and during which the corporation engages in a farming business. Any such election, once made, may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary.
