   General rule
   If—
   (1)
   a partnership has
   effectively connected taxable income
   for any taxable year, and
   (2)

   (b)
   Amount of withholding tax
   (1)
   In general
   The amount of the withholding tax payable by any partnership under subsection (a) shall be equal to the

   Special rules for withholding on dispositions of partnership interests
   (1)
   In general
   Except as provided in this subsection, if any portion of the gain (if any) on any disposition of an interest in a partnership would be treated under section 864(c)(8) as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, the transferee shall be required to deduct and withhold a tax equal to 10 percent of the amount realized on the disposition.
   (2)
   Exception if nonforeign affidavit furnished
   (A)
   In general
   No person shall be required to deduct and withhold any amount under paragraph (1) with respect to any disposition if the transferor furnishes to the transferee an affidavit by the transferor stating, under penalty of perjury, the transferor’s United States taxpayer identification number and that the transferor is not a foreign person.
   (B)
   False affidavit
   Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any disposition if—

   Rules for agents
   The rules of
   section 1445(d)

   (3)
   Authority of Secretary to prescribe reduced amount
   At the request of the transferor or transferee, the Secretary may prescribe a reduced amount to be withheld under this section if the Secretary determines that to substitute such reduced amount will not jeopardize the collection of the tax imposed under this title with respect to gain treated under

   as effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business with in the United States.
