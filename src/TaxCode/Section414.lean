   For purposes of this part—
   (1)
   in any case in which the employer maintains a plan of a predecessor employer, service for such predecessor shall be treated as service for the employer, and
   (2)
   in any case in which the employer maintains a plan which is not the plan maintained by a predecessor employer, service for such predecessor shall, to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, be treated as service for the employer.

   If application of paragraph (2) causes 2 or more entities to be a
   controlled group

   (iii)
   any additional period which the Secretary determines is reasonable or necessary for the correction of the default,

   under
   section 403(b)(3)
   shall be determined by reference to the minister’s
   earned income
   (within the meaning of section 401(c)(2)) from such ministry rather than the amount of
   compensation
   which is received from an employer, and
   (ii)
   the years (and portions of years) in which such minister was a self-employed individual (within the meaning of
   section 401(c)(1)(B)

The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purpose of, and prevent the abuse of, this subparagraph.

   (D)
   The fact that a plan makes an election under subparagraph (A)(ii) does not imply that the plan was not a
   multiemployer plan
   prior to the date of the election or would not be a
   multiemployer plan
   without regard to the election.
   (E)
   A plan is described in this subparagraph if it is a plan sponsored by an
   organization

   .
   (F)
   Maintenance under collective bargaining agreement.—
   For purposes of this title and the
   Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
   , a plan making an election under this paragraph shall be treated as maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement if a collective bargaining agreement, expressly or otherwise, provides for or permits employer contributions to the plan by one or more employers that are signatory to such agreement, or participation in the plan by one or more employees of an employer that is signatory to such agreement, regardless of whether the plan was created, established, or maintained for such employees by virtue of another document that is not a collective bargaining agreement.

   (2)
   Designation by units of government
   For purposes of paragraph (1), in the case of any plan established by the government of any State or political subdivision thereof, or by any agency or instrumentality of any of the foregoing, or a
   governmental plan
   described in the last sentence of section 414(d) (relating to plans of Indian

   defined contribution plan
   ,
   (2)
   for purposes of sections 72(d) (relating to treatment of employee contributions as separate contract), 411(a)(7)(A) (relating to minimum vesting standards), 415 (relating to limitations on benefits and contributions under qualified plans), and 401(m) (relating to nondiscrimination tests for matching requirements and employee contributions), be treated as consisting of a

   (1)
   In general
   A trust which forms a part of a plan shall not constitute a qualified trust under section 401 and a plan shall be treated as not described in section 403(a) unless in the case of any merger or consolidation of the plan with, or in the case of any transfer of assets or liabilities of such plan to, any other trust plan after
   September 2, 1974
   , each participant in the plan would (if the plan then terminated) receive a benefit immediately after the merger, consolidation, or transfer which is equal to or greater than the benefit he would have been entitled to receive immediately before the merger, consolidation, or transfer (if the plan had then terminated). The preceding sentence does not apply to any
   multiemployer plan

   that is corrected prospectively by implementing an automatic enrollment or automatic escalation feature with respect to an eligible employee (or an affirmative election made by an eligible employee) determined in accordance with the terms of an
   eligible automatic contribution arrangement
   (as defined under subsection (w)(3)), provided that—
   (i)
   such implementation error is corrected not later than—
   (I)
   the date of the first payment of
   compensation
   made by the employer to the employee on or after the last day of the 9½ month-period after the end of the plan year during which such error with respect to the employee first occurred, or
   (II)
   if earlier in the case of an employee who notifies the plan sponsor of such error, the date of the first payment of
   compensation
   made by the employer to the employee on or after the last day of the month following the month in which such notification was made,
   (ii)
   in the case of an employee who would have been entitled to additional matching contributions had any missed
   elective deferral
   been made, the plan sponsor makes a corrective allocation, not later than the deadline specified by the Secretary in regulations or other guidance prescribed under paragraph (3), of matching contributions on behalf of the employee in an amount equal to the additional matching contributions to which the employee would have been so entitled (adjusted to account for earnings had the missed
   elective deferrals
   been made).
   (iii)
   such implementation error is of a type which is so corrected for all similarly situated participants in a nondiscriminatory manner,
   (iv)
   notice of such error is given to the employee not later than 45 days after the date on which correct deferrals begin, and
   (v)
   the notice under clause (iv) satisfies such regulations or other guidance as the Secretary prescribes under paragraph (4).
   Such correction may occur before or after the participant has terminated employment and may occur without regard to whether the error is identified by the Secretary.
   (3)
   No obligation for employer to restore missed elective deferrals
   If the requirements of paragraph (2)(B) are satisfied, the employer will not be required to provide eligible employees with the missed amount of
   elective deferrals
   resulting from a reasonable administrative error described in paragraph (2)(A)(i) or (ii) through a qualified nonelective contribution, or otherwise.
   (4)
   Regulations and guidance for favorable correction methods
   The Secretary shall by regulations or other guidance of general applicability prescribe—
   (A)
   the deadline for making a corrective allocation of matching contributions required by paragraph (2)(B)(ii),
   (B)
   the content of the notice required by paragraph (2)(B)(iv),
   (C)
   the manner in which the amount of the corrective allocation under paragraph (2)(B)(ii) is determined,
   (D)
   the manner of adjustment to account for earnings on matching contributions under paragraph (2)(B)(ii), and
   (E)
   such other rules as are necessary to carry out the purposes of the subsection.
