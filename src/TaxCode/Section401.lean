   (a)
   Requirements for qualification
   A trust created or organized in the United States and forming part of a stock bonus, pension, or profit-sharing plan of an
   employer
   for the exclusive benefit of his
   employees
   or their beneficiaries shall constitute a qualified trust under this section—
   (1)
   if contributions are made to the trust by such
   employer
   , or
   employees,
   or both, or by another
   employer
   who is entitled to deduct his contributions under section 404(a)(3)(B) (relating to deduction for contributions to profit-sharing and stock bonus plans), or by a charitable remainder trust pursuant to a qualified gratuitous transfer (as defined in section 664(g)(1)), for the purpose of distributing to such
   employees
   or their beneficiaries the corpus and income of the fund accumulated by the trust in accordance with such plan;
   (2)
   if under the trust instrument it is impossible, at any time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to
   employees
   and their beneficiaries under the trust, for any part of the corpus or income to be (within the taxable year or thereafter) used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of his
   employees
   or their beneficiaries (but this paragraph shall not be construed, in the case of a
   multiemployer plan,
   to prohibit the return of a contribution within 6 months after the
   plan administrator
   determines that the contribution was made by a mistake of fact or law (other than a mistake relating to whether the plan is described in
   section 401(a)
   or the trust which is part of such plan is exempt from taxation under section 501(a), or the return of any withdrawal liability payment determined to be an overpayment within 6 months of such determination));
   (3)
   if the plan of which such trust is a part satisfies the requirements of section 410 (relating to minimum participation standards); and
   (4)
   if the contributions or benefits provided under the plan do not discriminate in favor of
   highly compensated employees
   (within the meaning of
   section 414(q)
   ). For purposes of this paragraph, there shall be excluded from consideration
   employees
   described in section 410(b)(3)(A) and (C).
   (5)
   Special rules relating to nondiscrimination requirements.—
   (A)
   Salaried or clerical employees.—
   A classification shall not be considered discriminatory within the meaning of paragraph (4) or
   section 410(b)(2)(A)(i)
   merely because it is limited to salaried or clerical
   employees.
   (B)
   Contributions and benefits may bear uniform relationship to compensation.—
   A plan shall not be considered discriminatory within the meaning of paragraph (4) merely because the contributions or benefits of, or on behalf of, the
   employees
   under the plan bear a uniform relationship to the
   compensation
   (within the meaning of section 414(s)) of such
   employees.
   (C)
   Certain disparity permitted.—
   A plan shall not be considered discriminatory within the meaning of paragraph (4) merely because the contributions or benefits of, or on behalf of, the
   employees
   under the plan favor
   highly compensated employees
   (as defined in
   section 414(q)
   ) in the manner permitted under subsection (l).
   (D)
   Integrated defined benefit plan.—
   (i)
   In general.—
   A
   defined benefit plan
   shall not be considered discriminatory within the meaning of paragraph (4) merely because the plan provides that the
   employer
   -derived accrued retirement benefit for any participant under the plan may not exceed the excess (if any) of—
   (I)
   the participant’s final pay with the
   employer
   , over
   (II)
   the
   employer
   -derived retirement benefit created under Federal law attributable to service by the participant with the
   employer
   .
   For purposes of this clause, the
   employer
   -derived retirement benefit created under Federal law shall be treated as accruing ratably over 35 years.
   (ii)
   Final pay.—
   For purposes of this subparagraph, the participant’s final pay is the
   compensation
   (as defined in
   section 414(q)(4)
   ) paid to the participant by the
   employer
   for any year—
   (I)
   which ends during the 5-year period ending with the year in which the participant separated from service for the
   employer
   , and
   (II)
   for which the participant’s total
   compensation
   from the
   employer
   was highest.
   (E)
   2 or more plans treated as single plan.—
   For purposes of determining whether 2 or more plans of an
   employer
   satisfy the requirements of paragraph (4) when considered as a single plan—
   (i)
   Contributions.—
   If the amount of contributions on behalf of the
   employees
   allowed as a deduction under
   section 404
   for the taxable year with respect to such plans, taken together, bears a uniform relationship to the
   compensation
   (within the meaning of section 414(s)) of such
   employees,
   the plans shall not be considered discriminatory merely because the rights of
   employees
   to, or derived from, the
   employer
   contributions under the separate plans do not become nonforfeitable at the same rate.
   (ii)
   Benefits.—
   If the
   employees
   ’ rights to benefits under the separate plans do not become nonforfeitable at the same rate, but the levels of benefits provided by the separate plans satisfy the requirements of regulations prescribed by the Secretary to take account of the differences in such rates, the plans shall not be considered discriminatory merely because of the difference in such rates.
   (F)
   Social security retirement age.—
   For purposes of testing for discrimination under paragraph (4)—
   (i)
   the
   social security retirement age
   (as defined in
   section 415(b)(8)
   ) shall be treated as a uniform retirement age, and
   (ii)
   subsidized early retirement benefits and joint and survivor annuities shall not be treated as being unavailable to
   employees
   on the same terms merely because such benefits or annuities are based in whole or in part on an
   employee
   ’s
   social security retirement age
   (as so defined).
   (G)
   Governmental plans.—
   Paragraphs (3) and (4) shall not apply to a
   governmental plan
   (within the meaning of
   section 414(d)
   ).
   (6)
   A plan shall be considered as meeting the requirements of paragraph (3) during the whole of any taxable year of the plan if on one day in each quarter it satisfied such requirements.
   (7)
   A trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan of which such trust is a part satisfies the requirements of section 411 (relating to minimum vesting standards).
   (8)
   A trust forming part of a
   defined benefit plan
   shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan provides that forfeitures must not be applied to increase the benefits any
   employee
   would otherwise receive under the plan.
   (9)
   Required distributions.—
   (A)
   In general.—
   A trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this subsection unless the plan provides that the entire interest of each
   employee

   employee
   not later than the
   required beginning date
   , or
   (ii)
   will be distributed, beginning not later than the
   required beginning date
   , in accordance with regulations, over the life of such
   employee
   or over the lives of such
   employee
   and a
   designated beneficiary
   (or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such
   employee
   or the life expectancy of such
   employee
   and a
   designated beneficiary)
   .
   (B)
   Required distribution where employee dies before entire interest is distributed.—
   (i)
   Where distributions have begun under subparagraph (A)(ii).—
   A trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan provides that if—
   (I)
   the distribution of the
   employee
   ’s interest has begun in accordance with subparagraph (A)(ii), and
   (II)
   the
   employee
   dies before his entire interest has been distributed to him,
   the remaining portion of such interest will be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distributions being used under subparagraph (A)(ii) as of the date of his death.
   (ii)
   5-year rule for other cases.—
   A trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan provides that, if an
   employee
   dies before the distribution of the
   employee
   ’s interest has begun in accordance with subparagraph (A)(ii), the entire interest of the
   employee
   will be distributed within 5 years after the death of such
   employee
   .
   (iii)
   Exception to 5-year rule for certain amounts payable over life of beneficiary.—
   If—
   (I)
   any portion of the
   employee
   ’s interest is payable to (or for the benefit of) a
   designated beneficiary
   ,
   (II)
   such portion will be distributed (in accordance with regulations) over the life of such
   designated beneficiary
   (or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such beneficiary), and
   (III)
   such distributions begin not later than 1 year after the date of the
   employee
   ’s death or such later date as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe,
   for purposes of clause (ii), the portion referred to in subclause (I) shall be treated as distributed on the date on which such distributions begin.
   (iv)
   Special rule for surviving spouse of employee.—
   If the
   designated beneficiary
   referred to in clause (iii)(I) is the surviving spouse of the
   employee
   and the surviving spouse elects the treatment in this clause—
   (I)
   the regulations referred to in clause (iii)(II) shall treat the surviving spouse as if the surviving spouse were the
   employee
   ,
   (II)
   the date on which the distributions are required to begin under clause (iii)(III) shall not be earlier than the date on which the
   employee
   would have attained the applicable age, and
   (III)
   if the surviving spouse dies before the distributions to such spouse begin, this subparagraph shall be applied as if the surviving spouse is the
   employee
   .
   An election described in this clause shall be made at such time and in such manner as prescribed by the Secretary, shall include a timely notice to the
   plan administrator
   , and once made may not be revoked except with the consent of the Secretary.
   (C)
   Required beginning date.—
   For purposes of this paragraph—
   (i)
   In general.—
   The term “

   In the case of an
   employee
   to whom clause (i)(II) applies who retires in a calendar year after the calendar year in which the
   employee
   attains age 70½, the

   employee
   was not receiving any benefits under the plan.

   annuity
   payments during the period being accelerated,

   designated beneficiary
   ),
   (II)
   such participant does not elect a payment of benefits in the form of a life

   (D)
   Special rule where participant and spouse married less than 1 year.—
   A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of subparagraphs (B)(iii) or (C) merely because the plan provides that benefits will not be payable to the surviving spouse of the participant unless the participant and such spouse had been married throughout the 1-year period ending on the earlier of the participant’s
   annuity
   starting date or the date of the participant’s death.
   (E)

   (12)
   A trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan of which such trust is a part provides that in the case of any merger or consolidation with, or transfer of assets or liabilities to, any other plan after
   September 2, 1974
   , each participant in the plan would (if the plan then terminated) receive a benefit immediately after the merger, consolidation, or transfer which is equal to or greater than the benefit he would have been entitled to receive immediately before the merger, consolidation, or transfer (if the plan had then terminated). The preceding sentence does not apply to any
   multiemployer plan
   with respect to any transaction to the extent that participants either before or after the transaction are covered under a
   multiemployer plan

   Assignment and alienation.—
   (A)
   In general.—
   A trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan of which such trust is a part provides that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated. For purposes of the preceding sentence, there shall not be taken into account any voluntary and revocable assignment of not to exceed 10 percent of any benefit payment made by any participant who is receiving benefits under the plan unless the assignment or alienation is made for purposes of defraying plan administration costs. For purposes of this paragraph a loan made to a participant or beneficiary shall not be treated as an assignment or alienation if such loan is secured by the participant’s accrued nonforfeitable benefit and is exempt from the tax imposed by section 4975 (relating to tax on prohibited transactions) by reason of section 4975(d)(1). This paragraph shall take effect on
   January 1, 1976
   and shall not apply to assignments which were irrevocable on
   September 2, 1974
   .

   Special rules for domestic relations orders.—
   Subparagraph (A) shall apply to the creation, assignment, or recognition of a right to any benefit payable with respect to a participant pursuant to a domestic relations order, except that subparagraph (A) shall not apply if the order is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order.
   (C)
   Special rule for certain judgments and settlements.—
   Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any offset of a participant’s benefits provided under a plan against an amount that the participant is ordered or required to pay to the plan if—
   (i)
   the order or requirement to pay arises—
   (I)
   under a judgment of conviction for a crime involving such plan,
   (II)
   under a civil judgment (including a consent order or decree) entered by a court in an action brought in connection with a violation (or alleged violation) of part 4 of subtitle B of title I of the
   Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
   , or
   (III)
   pursuant to a settlement agreement between the Secretary of Labor and the participant, or a settlement agreement between the
   Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
   and the participant, in connection with a violation (or alleged violation) of part 4 of such subtitle by a fiduciary or any other person,
   (ii)
   the judgment, order, decree, or settlement agreement expressly provides for the offset of all or part of the amount ordered or required to be paid to the plan against the participant’s benefits provided under the plan, and
   (iii)
   in a case in which the survivor
   annuity
   requirements of
   section 401(a)(11)
   apply with respect to distributions from the plan to the participant, if the participant has a spouse at the time at which the offset is to be made—
   (I)
   either such spouse has consented in writing to such offset and such consent is witnessed by a notary public or representative of the plan (or it is established to the satisfaction of a plan representative that such consent may not be obtained by reason of circumstances described in section 417(a)(2)(B)), or an election to waive the right of the spouse to either a qualified joint and survivor
   annuity
   or a qualified preretirement survivor
   annuity
   is in effect in accordance with the requirements of section 417(a),
   (II)
   such spouse is ordered or required in such judgment, order, decree, or settlement to pay an amount to the plan in connection with a violation of part 4 of such subtitle, or
   (III)
   in such judgment, order, decree, or settlement, such spouse retains the right to receive the survivor
   annuity
   under a qualified joint and survivor
   annuity
   provided pursuant to section 401(a)(11)(A)(i) and under a qualified preretirement survivor
   annuity
   provided pursuant to section 401(a)(11)(A)(ii), determined in accordance with subparagraph (D).
   A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subsection, subsection (k), section 403(b), or
   section 409(d)
   solely by reason of an offset described in this subparagraph.
   (D)
   Survivor annuity.—
   (i)
   In general.—
   The survivor
   annuity
   described in subparagraph (C)(iii)(III) shall be determined as if—
   (I)

   (II)
   there was no offset,
   (III)
   the plan permitted commencement of benefits only on or after normal retirement age,

   the plan provided only the
   minimum-required qualified joint and survivor annuity

   annuity

   minimum-required qualified joint and survivor annuity
   .
   (ii)
   Definition.—
   For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “
   minimum-required qualified joint and survivor annuity
   ” means the qualified joint and survivor
   annuity
   which is the actuarial equivalent of the participant’s accrued benefit (within the meaning of section 411(a)(7)) and under which the survivor
   annuity
   is 50 percent of the amount of the
   annuity
   which is payable during the joint lives of the participant and the spouse.
   (14)
   A trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan of which such trust is a part provides that, unless the participant otherwise elects, the payment of benefits under the plan to the participant will begin not later than the 60th day after the latest of the close of the plan year in which—
   (A)
   the date on which the participant attains the earlier of age 65 or the normal retirement age specified under the plan,
   (B)
   occurs the 10th anniversary of the year in which the participant commenced participation in the plan, or
   (C)
   the participant terminates his service with the
   employer
   .
   In the case of a plan which provides for the payment of an early retirement benefit, a trust forming a part of such plan shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless a participant who satisfied the service requirements for such early retirement benefit, but separated from the service (with any nonforfeitable right to an accrued benefit) before satisfying the age requirement for such early retirement benefit, is entitled upon satisfaction of such age requirement to receive a benefit not less than the benefit to which he would be entitled at the normal retirement age, actuarially, reduced under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.
   (15)
   A trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless under the plan of which such trust is a part—
   (A)
   in the case of a participant or beneficiary who is receiving benefits under such plan, or
   (B)
   in the case of a participant who is separated from the service and who has nonforfeitable rights to benefits,
   such benefits are not decreased by reason of any increase in the benefit levels payable under title II of the
   Social Security Act
   or any increase in the wage base under such title II, if such increase takes place after
   September 2, 1974
   , or (if later) the earlier of the date of first receipt of such benefits or the date of such separation, as the case may be.
   (16)

   (B)
   Cost-of-living adjustment.—
   The Secretary shall adjust annually the $200,000 amount in subparagraph (A) for increases in the cost-of-living at the same time and in the same manner as adjustments under section 415(d); except that the base period shall be the calendar quarter beginning

   A trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section if under the plan of which such trust is a part any part of a participant’s accrued benefit derived from
   employer
   contributions (whether or not otherwise nonforfeitable), is forfeitable solely because of withdrawal by such participant of any amount attributable to the benefit derived from contributions made by such participant. The preceding sentence shall not apply to the accrued benefit of any participant unless, at the time of such withdrawal, such participant has a nonforfeitable right to at least 50 percent of such accrued benefit (as determined under section 411). The first sentence of this paragraph shall not apply to the extent that an accrued benefit is permitted to be forfeited in accordance with section 411(a)(3)(D)(iii) (relating to proportional forfeitures of benefits accrued before
   September 2, 1974
   , in the event of withdrawal of certain mandatory contributions).
   (20)
   A trust forming part of a pension plan shall not be treated as failing to constitute a qualified trust under this section merely because the pension plan of which such trust is a part makes 1 or more distributions within 1 taxable year to a distributee on account of a termination of the plan of which the trust is a part, or in the case of a profit-sharing or stock bonus plan, a complete discontinuance of contributions under such plan. This paragraph shall not apply to a
   defined benefit plan

   employer
   maintaining such plan files a notice with the
   Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
   (at the time and in the manner prescribed by the
   Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
   ) notifying the Corporation of such payment or distribution and the Corporation has approved such payment or distribution or, within 90 days after the date on which such notice was filed, has failed to disapprove such payment or distribution. For purposes of this paragraph, rules similar to the rules of section 402(a)(6)(B) (as in effect before its repeal by section 521 of the

   employer
   whose stock is not readily tradable on an established market, and
   (B)
   after acquiring securities of the
   employer
   , more than 10 percent of the total assets of the plan are securities of the
   employer
   ,
   any trust forming part of such plan shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan meets the requirements of subsection (e) of section 409. The requirements of subsection (e) of section 409 shall not apply to any
   employees

   employer
   if the stock of such
   employer
   is not readily tradable on an established market and the trade or business of such
   employer
   consists of publishing on a regular basis a newspaper for general circulation. For purposes of the preceding sentence, subsections (b), (c), (m), and (

   ” shall include any securities of the
   employer

   (25)
   Requirement that actuarial assumptions be specified.—
   A
   defined benefit plan

   If
   employees
   described in section 410(b)(4)(B) are covered under a plan which meets the requirements of subparagraph (A) separately with respect to such
   employees
   , such
   employees
   may be excluded from consideration in determining whether any plan of the
   employer
   meets such requirements if—
   (I)
   the benefits for such
   employees
   are provided under the same plan as benefits for other
   employees
   ,
   (II)
   the benefits provided to such
   employees
   are not greater than comparable benefits provided to other
   employees
   under the plan, and
   (III)
   no
   highly compensated employee
   (within the meaning of
   section 414(q)
   ) is included in the group of such
   employees
   for more than 1 year.
   (C)

   At the election of the
   employer
   and with the consent of the Secretary, this paragraph may be applied separately with respect to each
   separate line of business
   of the
   employer.

   separate line of business
   ” has the meaning given such term by
   section 414(r)

   In general.—
   A plan shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of subparagraph (A) if—

   (bb)
   to provide future benefit accruals only to a closed class of participants,

   (iii)
   Special rules.—
   For purposes of clause (i)(II), in applying section 410(b)(6)(C), the amendments described in clause (i) shall not be treated as a significant change in coverage under section 410(b)(6)(C)(i)(II).
   (iv)
   Spun-off plans.—
   For purposes of this subparagraph, if a portion of a plan described in clause (i) is spun off to another

   employer
   .

   Determinations as to profit-sharing plans.—
   (A)
   Contributions need not be based on profits.—
   The determination of whether the plan under which any contributions are made is a profit-sharing plan shall be made without regard to current or accumulated profits of the
   employer
   and without regard to whether the
   employer
   is a tax-exempt organization.
   (B)
   Plan must designate type.—

   Investment Company Act of 1940
   (15 U.S.C., sec.
   80a–2
   ); but does not include any contract or certificate issued after
   December 31, 1962

   (h)
   Medical, etc., benefits for retired employees and their spouses and dependents
   Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, and subject to the provisions of section 420, a pension or
   annuity
   plan may provide for the payment of benefits for sickness, accident, hospitalization, and medical expenses of retired
   employees
   , their spouses and their
   dependents
   , but only if—
   (1)
   such benefits are subordinate to the retirement benefits provided by the plan,
   (2)
   a separate account is established and maintained for such benefits,
   (3)
   the
   employer
   ’s contributions to such separate account are reasonable and ascertainable,
   (4)
   it is impossible, at any time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the plan to provide such benefits, for any part of the corpus or income of such separate account to be (within the taxable year or thereafter) used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than the providing of such benefits,
   (5)
   notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(2), upon the satisfaction of all liabilities under the plan to provide such benefits, any amount remaining in such separate account must, under the terms of the plan, be returned to the
   employer
   , and
   (6)
   in the case of an
   employee
   who is a
   key employee
   , a separate account is established and maintained for such benefits payable to such
   employee
   (and his spouse and
   dependents)
   and such benefits (to the extent attributable to plan years beginning after
   March 31, 1984
   , for which the
   employee
   is a
   key employee)
   are only payable to such
   employee
   (and his spouse and
   dependents)
   from such separate account.
   For purposes of paragraph (6), the term “
   key employee
   ” means any
   employee,
   who at any time during the plan year or any preceding plan year during which contributions were made on behalf of such
   employee,
   is or was a
   key employee
   as defined in section 416(i). In no event shall the requirements of paragraph (1) be treated as met if the aggregate actual contributions for medical benefits, when added to actual contributions for life insurance protection under the plan, exceed 25 percent of the total actual contributions to the plan (other than contributions to fund past service credits) after the date on which the account is established. For purposes of this subsection, the term
   “dependent”
   shall include any individual who is a child (as defined in section 152(f)(1)) of a retired
   employee
   who as of the end of the calendar year has not attained age 27.
   (i)
   Certain union-negotiated pension plans
   In the case of a trust forming part of a pension plan which has been determined by the Secretary to constitute a qualified trust under subsection (a) and to be exempt from taxation under section 501(a) for a period beginning after contributions were first made to or for such trust, if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary that—
   (1)
   such trust was created pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between
   employee
   representatives and one or more
   employers
   ,
   (2)
   any disbursements of contributions, made to or for such trust before the time as of which the Secretary determined that the trust constituted a qualified trust, substantially complied with the terms of the trust, and the plan of which the trust is a part, as subsequently qualified, and
   (3)
   before the time as of which the Secretary determined that the trust constitutes a qualified trust, the contributions to or for such trust were not used in a manner which would jeopardize the interests of its beneficiaries,
   then such trust shall be considered as having constituted a qualified trust under subsection (a) and as having been exempt from taxation under
   section 501(a)
   for the period beginning on the date on which contributions were first made to or for such trust and ending on the date such trust first constituted (without regard to this subsection) a qualified trust under subsection (a).

   If any
   highly compensated employee
   is a participant under 2 or more cash or deferred arrangements of the
   employer,
   for purposes of determining the deferral percentage with respect to such
   employee,
   all such cash or deferred arrangements shall be treated as 1 cash or deferred arrangement. An arrangement may apply clause (ii) by using the plan year rather than the preceding plan year if the
   employer

   by more than 50 percent. In the case of a CSEC plan (as defined in section 414(y)), the normal cost of the plan (as determined under section 433(j)(1)(B)) shall be used in lieu of the amount determined under section 430(b)(1)(A)(i).
   (H)
   Treatment as single plan
   For purposes of subparagraphs (E) and (G), a plan described in
   section 413(c)
   shall be treated as a single plan rather than as separate plans maintained by each
   employer
   in the plan.
   (I)
   Special rules
   For purposes of subparagraphs (A)(i) and (B)(iii)(II), the following rules shall apply:
   (i)
   In applying section 410(b)(6)(C), the closing of the class of participants shall not be treated as a significant change in coverage under section 410(b)(6)(C)(i)(II).
   (ii)
   2 or more plans shall not fail to be eligible to be aggregated and treated as a single plan solely by reason of having different plan years.
   (iii)
   Changes in the
   employee
   population shall be disregarded to the extent attributable to individuals who become
   employees
   or cease to be
   employees
   , after the date the class is closed, by reason of a merger, acquisition, divestiture, or similar event.
   (iv)
   Aggregation and all other testing methodologies otherwise applicable under subsection (a)(4) and
   section 410(b)
   may be taken into account.
   The rule of clause (ii) shall also apply for purposes of determining whether plans to which subparagraph (B)(i) applies may be aggregated and treated as 1 plan for purposes of determining whether such plans meet the requirements of subsection (a)(4) and section 410(b).
   (J)
   Spun-off plans
   For purposes of this paragraph, if a portion of a
   defined benefit plan
   described in subparagraph (A) or (B)(iii) is spun off to another
   employer
   and the spun-off plan continues to satisfy the requirements of—
   (i)
   subparagraph (A)(i) or (B)(iii)(II), whichever is applicable, if the original plan was still within the 3-year period described in such subparagraph at the time of the spin off, and
   (ii)
   subparagraph (A)(ii) or (B)(iii)(III), whichever is applicable,
   the treatment under subparagraph (A) or (B) of the spun-off plan shall continue with respect to such other
   employer
   .
   (2)
   Testing of defined contribution plans
   (A)
   Testing on a benefits basis
   A
   defined contribution plan
   shall be permitted to be tested on a benefits basis if—
   (i)
   such
   defined contribution plan
   provides
   make-whole contributions
   to a closed class of participants whose accruals under a
   defined benefit plan
   have been reduced or eliminated,
   (ii)
   for the plan year of the
   defined contribution plan
   as of which the class eligible to receive such
   make-whole contributions
   closes and the 2 succeeding plan years, such closed class of participants satisfies the requirements of
   section 410(b)(2)(A)(i)
   (determined by applying the rules of paragraph (1)(I)),
   (iii)
   after the date as of which the class was closed, any plan amendment to the
   defined contribution plan
   which modifies the closed class or the allocations, benefits, rights, and features provided to such closed class does not discriminate significantly in favor of
   highly compensated employees
   , and
   (iv)
   the class was closed before
   April 5, 2017
   , or the
   defined benefit plan
   under clause (i) is described in paragraph (1)(C) (as applied for purposes of paragraph (1)(B)(iii)(IV)).
   (B)
   Aggregation with plans including matching contributions
   (i)
   In general
   With respect to 1 or more
   defined contribution plans
   described in subparagraph (A), for purposes of determining compliance with subsection (a)(4) and section 410(b), the portion of such plans which provides
   make-whole contributions
   or other nonelective contributions may be aggregated and tested on a benefits basis with the portion of 1 or more other
   defined contribution plans
   which—
   (I)
   provides
   matching contributions
   (as defined in subsection (m)(4)(A)),
   (II)
   provides
   annuity
   contracts described in
   section 403(b)
   which are purchased with
   matching contributions
   or nonelective contributions, or
   (III)
   consists of an
   employee stock ownership plan
   (within the meaning of
   section 4975(e)(7)
   ) or a tax credit
   employee stock ownership plan
   (within the meaning of section 409(a)).
   (ii)
   Special rules for matching contributions
   Rules similar to the rules of paragraph (1)(B)(ii) shall apply for purposes of clause (i).
   (C)
   Special rules for testing defined contribution plan features providing matching contributions to certain older, longer service participants
   In the case of a
   defined contribution plan
   which provides benefits, rights, or features to a closed class of participants whose accruals under a
   defined benefit plan
   have been reduced or eliminated, the plan shall not fail to satisfy the requirements of subsection (a)(4) solely by reason of the composition of the closed class or the benefits, rights, or features provided to such closed class if the
   defined contribution plan
   and
   defined benefit plan
   otherwise meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) but for the fact that the
   make-whole contributions
   under the
   defined contribution plan
   are made in whole or in part through
   matching contributions.
   (D)
   Spun-off plans
   For purposes of this paragraph, if a portion of a
   defined contribution plan
   described in subparagraph (A) or (C) is spun off to another
   employer
   , the treatment under subparagraph (A) or (C) of the spun-off plan shall continue with respect to the other
   employer
   if such plan continues to comply with the requirements of clauses (ii) (if the original plan was still within the 3-year period described in such clause at the time of the spin off) and (iii) of subparagraph (A), as determined for purposes of subparagraph (A) or (C), whichever is applicable.
   (3)
   Definitions and special rule
   For purposes of this subsection—
   (A)
   Make-whole contributions
   Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (2)(C), the term “
   make-whole contributions
   ” means nonelective allocations for each
   employee
   in the class which are reasonably calculated, in a consistent manner, to replace some or all of the retirement benefits which the
   employee
   would have received under the
   defined benefit plan
   and any other plan or qualified cash or deferred arrangement under subsection (k)(2) if no change had been made to such
   defined benefit plan
   and such other plan or arrangement. For purposes of the preceding sentence, consistency shall not be required with respect to
   employees
   who were subject to different benefit formulas under the
   defined benefit plan.
   (B)
   References to closed class of participants
   References to a closed class of participants and similar references to a closed class shall include arrangements under which 1 or more classes of participants are closed, except that 1 or more classes of participants closed on different dates shall not be aggregated for purposes of determining the date any such class was closed.
   (C)
   Highly compensated employee
   The term “
   highly compensated employee
   ” has the meaning given such term in section 414(q).
   (p)
   Cross reference

   “(c)
   EPCRS for IRAs.—

   waivers of the excise tax which would otherwise apply under section 4974 of the
   Internal Revenue Code of 1986

   Correction Methods for Eligible Inadvertent Failures.—
   The Secretary shall issue guidance on correction methods that are required to be used to correct eligible inadvertent failures, including general principles of correction if a specific correction method is not specified by the Secretary.

   “(B)
   satisfy similar standards in the case of an individual retirement plan.

   section 401(a)
   [subsec. (a) of this section], or a plan described in section 403(a) or 405(a), including plans or arrangements described in subsection (b)(2), if the contribution is made under an arrangement under which the contribution will be made only if the
   employee
   elects to receive a reduction in his
   compensation
   or to forego an increase in his
   compensation,
   or under an arrangement under which the
   employee
   is permitted to elect to receive part of his
   compensation
   in one or more alternative forms (if one of such forms results in the inclusion of amounts in income under the
   Internal Revenue Code of 1986
