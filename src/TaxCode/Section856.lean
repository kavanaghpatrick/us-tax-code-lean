   A
   real estate investment trust
   which meets the requirements of this paragraph at the close of any quarter shall not lose its status as a
   real estate investment trust
   because of a discrepancy during a subsequent quarter between the
   value
   of its various investments and such requirements (including a discrepancy caused solely by the change in the foreign currency exchange rate used to
   value
   a foreign asset) unless such discrepancy exists immediately after the acquisition of any security or other property and is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition. A
   real estate investment trust
   which does not meet such requirements at the close of any quarter by reason of a discrepancy existing immediately after the acquisition of any security or other property which is wholly or partly the result of such acquisition during such quarter shall not lose its status for such quarter as a
   real estate investment trust
   if such discrepancy is eliminated within 30 days after the close of such quarter and in such cases it shall be considered to have met such requirements at the close of such quarter for purposes of applying the preceding sentence.
   (5)
   For purposes of this part—
   (A)
   The term “
   value
   ” means, with respect to securities for which market quotations are readily available, the market
   value
   of such securities; and with respect to other securities and assets, fair
   value
   as determined in good faith by the trustees, except that in the case of securities of
   real estate investment trusts
   such fair
   value
   shall not exceed market
   value
   or asset
   value,
   whichever is higher.
   (B)
   The term “
   real estate assets
   ” means real property (including
   interests in real property
   and
   interests
   in mortgages on real property or on
   interests in real property
   ),
   shares
   (or transferable certificates of beneficial
   interest)
   in other
   real estate investment trusts
   which meet the requirements of this part, and debt instruments issued by
   publicly offered REITs.
   Such term also includes any property (not otherwise a real estate asset) attributable to the temporary investment of
   new capital,
   but only if such property is stock or a debt instrument, and only for the 1-year period beginning on the date the real estate trust receives such capital.
   (C)
   The term “
   interests in real property
   ” includes fee ownership and co-ownership of land or improvements thereon, leaseholds of land or improvements thereon, options to acquire land or improvements thereon, and options to acquire leaseholds of land or improvements thereon, but does not include mineral, oil, or gas royalty
   interests.
   (D)
   Qualified temporary investment income.—
   (i)
   In general.—
   The term “
   qualified temporary investment income
   ” means any income which—
   (I)
   is attributable to stock or a debt instrument (within the meaning of
   section 1275(a)(1)
   ),
   (II)
   is attributable to the temporary investment of
   new capital
   , and
   (III)
   is received or accrued during the 1-year period beginning on the date on which the
   real estate investment trust
   receives such capital.
   (ii)
   New capital.—
   The term “
   new capital
   ” means any amount received by the
   real estate investment trust
   —
   (I)
   in exchange for stock (or certificates of beneficial
   interests
   ) in such trust (other than amounts received pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan), or
   (II)
   in a public offering of debt obligations of such trust which have maturities of at least 5 years.
   (E)
   A regular or residual
   interest
   in a REMIC shall be treated as a real estate asset, and any amount includible in gross income with respect to such an
   interest
   shall be treated as
   interest
   on an obligation secured by a mortgage on real property; except that, if less than 95 percent of the assets of such REMIC are
   real estate assets
   (determined as if the
   real estate investment trust
   held such assets), such
   real estate investment trust
   shall be treated as holding directly (and as receiving directly) its proportionate share of the assets and income of the REMIC. For purposes of determining whether any
   interest
   in a REMIC qualifies under the preceding sentence, any
   interest
   held by such REMIC in another REMIC shall be treated as a real estate asset under principles similar to the principles of the preceding sentence, except that, if such REMIC’s are part of a tiered structure, they shall be treated as one REMIC for purposes of this subparagraph.
   (F)

   section 1221(b)(2)(A)
   ), including gain from the sale or
   disposition
   of such a transaction, shall not constitute gross income under paragraphs (2) and (3) to the extent that the transaction hedges any indebtedness incurred or to be incurred by the trust to acquire or carry
   real estate assets,
   (ii)
   any income of a
   real estate investment trust
   from a transaction entered into by the trust primarily to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain described in paragraph (2) or (3) (or any property which generates such income or gain), including gain from the termination of such a transaction, shall not constitute gross income under paragraphs (2) and (3),
   (iii)
   if—
   (I)
   a

   (II)
   any portion of such indebtedness is extinguished or any portion of such property is disposed of, and
   (III)

   disposition
   , such trust enters into one or more transactions which would be hedging transactions described in clause (ii) or (iii) of

   clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) shall not apply with respect to any transaction unless such transaction satisfies the identification requirement described in

   , the cutting of which is provided by a
   taxable REIT subsidiary
   of the
   real estate investment trust
   ;
   (II)
   recognized under section 631(b); or
   (III)
   income which would constitute gain under subclause (I) or (II) but for the failure to meet the 1-year holding period requirement.
   (ii)
   Special rules.—

   of the
   real estate investment trust
   on the first day of the taxable year.

   does not otherwise qualify under paragraph (2) or (3) may be considered as not constituting gross income for purposes of paragraphs (2) or (3), or

   (A)
   following the corporation, trust, or association’s identification of the failure to meet the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3), or of both such paragraphs, for any taxable year, a description of each item of its gross income described in such paragraphs is set forth in a schedule for such taxable year filed in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, and

   A corporation, trust, or association that fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (4)(B)(iv) for a particular quarter shall nevertheless be considered to have satisfied the requirements of such paragraph for such quarter if—
   (i)

   (II)
   the amount determined (pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Secretary) by multiplying the net income generated by the assets described in the schedule specified in subparagraph (A)(i) for the period specified in clause (ii) by the highest rate of tax specified in section 11.
   (ii)
   Period.—
   For purposes of clause (i)(II), the period described in this clause is the period beginning on the first date that the failure to satisfy the requirements of such paragraph (4) occurs as a result of the ownership of such assets and ending on the earlier of the date on which the trust disposes of such assets or the end of the first quarter when there is no longer a failure to satisfy such paragraph (4).
   (iii)
   Administrative provisions.—
   For purposes of subtitle F, the taxes imposed by this subparagraph shall be treated as excise taxes with respect to which the deficiency procedures of such subtitle apply.
   (8)
   Election after tax-free reorganization.—
   If a corporation was a distributing corporation or a controlled corporation (other than a controlled corporation with respect to a distribution described in section 355(h)(2)(A)) with respect to any distribution to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) applied, such corporation (and any successor corporation) shall not be eligible to make any election under paragraph (1) for any taxable year beginning before the end of the 10-year period beginning on the date of such distribution.

   (II)
   any portion of such personal property and any portion of such real property are sold, or otherwise disposed of, in a single
   disposition
   (or contemporaneously in separate
   dispositions
   ), and
   (III)
   the fair market
   value
   of the personal property so sold or contemporaneously disposed of (determined at the time of

   For purposes of subparagraph (C), with respect to each lease of real property, rent attributable to personal property for the taxable year is that amount which bears the same ratio to total rent for the taxable year as the average of the fair market
   values
   of the personal property at the beginning and at the end of the taxable year bears to the average of the aggregate fair market
