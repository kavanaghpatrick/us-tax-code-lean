   (a)
   In general
   Whenever under section 3303(b) or section 3304(c) the Secretary of Labor makes a finding pursuant to which he is required to withhold a certification with respect to a
   State
   under such section, such
   State
   may, within 60 days after the Governor of the
   State
   has been notified of such action, file with the
   United States
   court of appeals for the circuit in which such
   State
   is located or with the
   United States
   Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, a petition for review of such action. A copy of the petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary of Labor. The Secretary of Labor thereupon shall file in the court the record of the proceedings on which he based his action as provided in
   section 2112 of title 28
   of the
   United States
   Code.
   (b)
   Findings of fact
   The findings of fact by the Secretary of Labor, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive; but the court, for good cause shown, may remand the case to the Secretary of Labor to take further evidence, and the Secretary of Labor may thereupon make new or modified findings of fact and may modify his previous action, and shall certify to the court the record of the further proceedings. Such new or modified findings of fact shall likewise be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.
   (c)
   Jurisdiction of court; review
   The court shall have jurisdiction to affirm the action of the Secretary of Labor or to set it aside, in whole or in part. The judgment of the court shall be subject to review by the
   Supreme Court of the United States
   upon certiorari or certification as provided in
   section 1254 of title 28
   of the
   United States
   Code.
   (d)
   Stay of Secretary of Labor’s action
   (1)
   The Secretary of Labor shall not withhold any certification under section 3303(b) or section 3304(c) until the expiration of 60 days after the Governor of the
   State
   has been notified of the action referred to in subsection (a) or until the
   State
   has filed a petition for review of such action, whichever is earlier.
   (2)
   The commencement of judicial proceedings under this section shall stay the Secretary of Labor’s action for a period of 30 days, and the court may thereafter grant interim relief if warranted, including a further stay of the Secretary of Labor’s action and including such other relief as may be necessary to preserve status or rights.
