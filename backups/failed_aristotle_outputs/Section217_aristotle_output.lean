   Definition of moving expenses
   (1)
   In general
   For purposes of this section, the term “
   moving expenses
   ” means only the reasonable expenses—
   (A)
   of moving household goods and personal effects from the former residence to the new residence, and
   (B)
   of traveling (including lodging) from the former residence to the new place of residence.
   Such term shall not include any expenses for meals.
   (2)
   Individuals other than taxpayer
   In the case of any individual other than the taxpayer, expenses referred to in paragraph (1) shall be taken into account only if such individual has both the former residence and the new residence as his principal place of abode and is a member of the taxpayer’s household.
   (c)
   Conditions for allowance
   No deduction shall be allowed under this section unless—
   (1)
   the taxpayer’s new principal place of work—
   (A)
   is at least 50 miles farther from his former residence than was his former principal place of work, or
   (B)
   if he had no former principal place of work, is at least 50 miles from his former residence, and
   (2)
   either—
   (A)
   during the 12-month period immediately following his arrival in the general location of his new principal place of work, the taxpayer is a full-time employee, in such general location, during at least 39 weeks, or
   (B)
   during the 24-month period immediately following his arrival in the general location of his new principal place of work, the taxpayer is a full-time employee or performs services as a
   self-employed individual
   on a full-time basis, in such general location, during at least 78 weeks, of which not less than 39 weeks are during the 12-month period referred to in subparagraph (A).
   For purposes of paragraph (1), the distance between two points shall be the shortest of the more commonly traveled routes between such two points.
   (d)
   Rules for application of subsection (c)(2)
   (1)
   The condition of subsection (c)(2) shall not apply if the taxpayer is unable to satisfy such condition by reason of—
   (A)
   death or disability, or
   (B)
   involuntary separation (other than for willful misconduct) from the service of, or transfer for the benefit of, an employer after obtaining full-time employment in which the taxpayer could reasonably have been expected to satisfy such condition.
   (2)
   If a taxpayer has not satisfied the condition of subsection (c)(2) before the time prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the return for the taxable year during which he paid or incurred
   moving expenses
   which would otherwise be deductible under this section, but may still satisfy such condition, then such expenses may (at the election of the taxpayer) be deducted for such taxable year notwithstanding subsection (c)(2).
   (3)
   If—
   (A)
   for any taxable year
   moving expenses
   have been deducted in accordance with the rule provided in paragraph (2), and
   (B)
   the condition of subsection (c)(2) cannot be satisfied at the close of a subsequent taxable year,
   then an amount equal to the expenses which were so deducted shall be included in gross income for the first such subsequent taxable year.
