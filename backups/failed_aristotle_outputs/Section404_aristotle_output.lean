   (a)
   General rule
   If contributions are paid by an employer to or under a stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, or annuity plan, or if compensation is paid or accrued on account of any
   employee
   under a plan deferring the receipt of such compensation, such contributions or compensation shall not be deductible under this chapter; but, if they would otherwise be deductible, they shall be deductible under this section, subject, however, to the following limitations as to the amounts deductible in any year:
   (1)
   Pension trusts
   (A)
   In general
   In the taxable year when paid, if the contributions are paid into a pension trust (other than a trust to which paragraph (3) applies), and if such taxable year ends within or with a taxable year of the trust for which the trust is exempt under section 501(a), in the case of a
   defined benefit plan
   other than a
   multiemployer plan,
   in an amount determined under subsection (
   o
   ), and in the case of any other plan in an amount determined as follows:
   (i)
   the amount necessary to satisfy the minimum funding standard provided by
   section 412(a)
   for plan years ending within or with such taxable year (or for any prior plan year), if such amount is greater than the amount determined under clause (ii) or (iii) (whichever is applicable with respect to the plan),
   (ii)
   the amount necessary to provide with respect to all of the
   employees
   under the trust the remaining unfunded cost of their past and current service credits distributed as a level amount, or a level percentage of compensation, over the remaining future service of each such
   employee
   , as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, but if such remaining unfunded cost with respect to any 3 individuals is more than 50 percent of such remaining unfunded cost, the amount of such unfunded cost attributable to such individuals shall be distributed over a period of at least 5 taxable years,
   (iii)
   an amount equal to the normal cost of the plan, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, plus, if past service or other supplementary pension or annuity credits are provided by the plan, an amount necessary to amortize the unfunded costs attributable to such credits in equal annual payments (until fully amortized) over 10 years, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.
   In determining the amount deductible in such year under the foregoing limitations the funding method and the actuarial assumptions used shall be those used for such year under section 431, and the maximum amount deductible for such year shall be an amount equal to the full funding limitation for such year determined under section 431.
   (B)
   Special rule in case of certain amendments
   In the case of a
   multiemployer plan
   which the Secretary of Labor finds to be collectively bargained which makes an election under this subparagraph (in such manner and at such time as may be provided under regulations prescribed by the Secretary), if the full funding limitation determined under
   section 431(c)(6)
   for such year is zero, if as a result of any plan amendment applying to such plan year, the amount determined under section 431(c)(6)(A)(ii) exceeds the amount determined under section 431(c)(6)(A)(i), and if the funding method and the actuarial assumptions used are those used for such year under section 431, the maximum amount deductible in such year under the limitations of this paragraph shall be an amount equal to the lesser of—
   (i)
   the full funding limitation for such year determined by applying
   section 431(c)(6)
   but increasing the amount referred to in subparagraph (A) thereof by the decrease in the present value of all unamortized liabilities resulting from such amendment, or
   (ii)
   the normal cost under the plan reduced by the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments over 10 years (until fully amortized) the decrease described in clause (i).
   In the case of any election under this subparagraph, the amount deductible under the limitations of this paragraph with respect to any of the plan years following the plan year for which such election was made shall be determined as provided under such regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary to carry out the purposes of this subparagraph.
   (C)
   Certain collectively-bargained plans
   In the case of a plan which the Secretary of Labor finds to be collectively bargained, established or maintained by an employer doing business in not less than 40 States and engaged in the trade or business of furnishing or selling services described in section 168(i)(10)(C), with respect to which the rates have been established or approved by a State or political subdivision thereof, by any agency or instrumentality of the United States, or by a public service or public utility commission or other similar body of any State or political subdivision thereof, and in the case of any employer which is a member of a
   controlled group
   with such employer, subparagraph (B) shall be applied by substituting for the words “plan amendment” the words “plan amendment or increase in benefits payable under title II of the
   Social Security Act
   ”. For the purposes of this subparagraph, the term
   “controlled group”
   has the meaning provided by section 1563(a), determined without regard to section 1563(a)(4) and (e)(3)(C).
   (D)
   Amount determined on basis of unfunded current liability
   In the case of a
   defined benefit plan
   which is a
   multiemployer plan,
   except as provided in regulations, the maximum amount deductible under the limitations of this paragraph shall not be less than the excess (if any) of—
   (i)
   140 percent of the current liability of the plan determined under section 431(c)(6)(D), over
   (ii)
   the value of the plan’s assets determined under section 431(c)(2).
   (E)
   Carryover
   Any amount paid in a taxable year in excess of the amount deductible in such year under the foregoing limitations shall be deductible in the succeeding taxable years in order of time to the extent of the difference between the amount paid and deductible in each such succeeding year and the maximum amount deductible for such year under the foregoing limitations.
   (2)
   Employees’ annuities
   In the taxable year when paid, in an amount determined in accordance with paragraph (1), if the contributions are paid toward the purchase of retirement annuities, or retirement annuities and medical benefits as described in section 401(h), and such purchase is part of a plan which meets the requirements of section 401(a)(3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (11), (12), (13), (14), (15), (16), (17),
   [1]
   (19), (20), (22), (26), (27), (31), and (37) and, if applicable, the requirements of section 401(a)(10) and of section 401(d), and if refunds of premiums, if any, are applied within the current taxable year or next succeeding taxable year toward the purchase of such retirement annuities, or such retirement annuities and medical benefits.
   (3)
   Stock bonus and profit-sharing trusts
   (A)
   Limits on deductible contributions
   (i)
   In general
   In the taxable year when paid, if the contributions are paid into a stock bonus or profit-sharing trust, and if such taxable year ends within or with a taxable year of the trust with respect to which the trust is exempt under section 501(a), in an amount not in excess of the greater of—
   (I)
   25 percent of the compensation otherwise paid or accrued during the taxable year to the beneficiaries under the stock bonus or profit-sharing plan, or
   (II)
   the amount such employer is required to contribute to such trust under
   section 401(k)(11)
   for such year.
   (ii)
   Carryover of excess contributions
   Any amount paid into the trust in any taxable year in excess of the limitation of clause (i) (or the corresponding provision of prior law) shall be deductible in the succeeding taxable years in order of time, but the amount so deductible under this clause in any 1 such succeeding taxable year together with the amount allowable under clause (i) shall not exceed the amount described in subclause (I) or (II) of clause (i), whichever is greater, with respect to such taxable year.
   (iii)
   Certain retirement plans excluded
   For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “stock bonus or profit-sharing trust” shall not include any trust designed to provide benefits upon retirement and covering a period of years, if under the plan the amounts to be contributed by the employer can be determined actuarially as provided in paragraph (1).
   (iv)
   2 or more trusts treated as 1 trust
   If the contributions are made to 2 or more stock bonus or profit-sharing trusts, such trusts shall be considered a single trust for purposes of applying the limitations in this subparagraph.
   (v)
   Defined contribution plans subject to the funding standards
   Except as provided by the Secretary, a
   defined contribution plan
   which is subject to the funding standards of
   section 412
   shall be treated in the same manner as a stock bonus or profit-sharing plan for purposes of this subparagraph.
   (B)
   Profit-sharing plan of affiliated group
   In the case of a profit-sharing plan, or a stock bonus plan in which contributions are determined with reference to profits, of a group of corporations which is an affiliated group within the meaning of section 1504, if any member of such affiliated group is prevented from making a contribution which it would otherwise have made under the plan, by reason of having no current or accumulated earnings or profits or because such earnings or profits are less than the contributions which it would otherwise have made, then so much of the contribution which such member was so prevented from making may be made, for the benefit of the
   employees
   of such member, by the other members of the group, to the extent of current or accumulated earnings or profits, except that such contribution by each such other member shall be limited, where the group does not file a consolidated return, to that proportion of its total current and accumulated earnings or profits remaining after adjustment for its contribution deductible without regard to this subparagraph which the total prevented contribution bears to the total current and accumulated earnings or profits of all the members of the group remaining after adjustment for all contributions deductible without regard to this subparagraph. Contributions made under the preceding sentence shall be deductible under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph by the employer making such contribution, and, for the purpose of determining amounts which may be carried forward and deducted under the second sentence of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph in succeeding taxable years, shall be deemed to have been made by the employer on behalf of whose
   employees
   such contributions were made.
   (4)
   Trusts created or organized outside the United States
   If a stock bonus, pension, or profit-sharing trust would qualify for exemption under section 501(a) except for the fact that it is a trust created or organized outside the United States, contributions to such a trust by an employer which is a resident, or corporation, or other entity of the United States, shall be deductible under the preceding paragraphs.
   (5)
   Other plans
   If the plan is not one included in paragraph (1), (2), or (3), in the taxable year in which an amount attributable to the contribution is includible in the gross income of
   employees
   participating in the plan, but, in the case of a plan in which more than one
   employee
   participates only if separate accounts are maintained for each
   employee
   . For purposes of this section, any vacation pay which is treated as deferred compensation shall be deductible for the taxable year of the employer in which paid to the
   employee
   .
   (6)
   Time when contributions deemed made
   For purposes of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), a taxpayer shall be deemed to have made a payment on the last day of the preceding taxable year if the payment is on account of such taxable year and is made not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the return for such taxable year (including extensions thereof).
   (7)
   Limitation on deductions where combination of defined contribution plan and defined benefit plan
   (A)
   In general
   If amounts are deductible under the foregoing paragraphs of this subsection (other than paragraph (5)) in connection with 1 or more
   defined contribution plans
   and 1 or more
   defined benefit plans
   or in connection with trusts or plans described in 2 or more of such paragraphs, the total amount deductible in a taxable year under such plans shall not exceed the greater of—
   (i)
   25 percent of the compensation otherwise paid or accrued during the taxable year to the beneficiaries under such plans, or
   (ii)
   the amount of contributions made to or under the
   defined benefit plans
   to the extent such contributions do not exceed the amount of employer contributions necessary to satisfy the minimum funding standard provided by
   section 412
   with respect to any such
   defined benefit plans
   for the plan year which ends with or within such taxable year (or for any prior plan year).
   A
   defined contribution plan
   which is a pension plan shall not be treated as failing to provide definitely determinable benefits merely by limiting employer contributions to amounts deductible under this section. In the case of a
   defined benefit plan
   which is a single employer plan, the amount necessary to satisfy the minimum funding standard provided by section 412 shall not be less than the excess (if any) of the plan’s funding target (as defined in section 430(d)(1)) over the value of the plan’s assets (as determined under section 430(g)(3)).
   (B)
   Carryover of contributions in excess of the deductible limit
   Any amount paid under the plans in any taxable year in excess of the limitation of subparagraph (A) shall be deductible in the succeeding taxable years in order of time, but the amount so deductible under this subparagraph in any 1 such succeeding taxable year together with the amount allowable under subparagraph (A) shall not exceed 25 percent of the compensation otherwise paid or accrued during such taxable year to the beneficiaries under the plans.
   (C)
   Paragraph not to apply in certain cases
   (i)
   Beneficiary test
   This paragraph shall not have the effect of reducing the amount otherwise deductible under paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), if no
   employee
   is a beneficiary under more than 1 trust or under a trust and an annuity plan.
   (ii)
   Elective deferrals
   If, in connection with 1 or more
   defined contribution plans
   and 1 or more
   defined benefit plans,
   no amounts (other than
   elective deferrals
   (as defined in section 402(g)(3))) are contributed to any of the
   defined contribution plans
   for the taxable year, then subparagraph (A) shall not apply with respect to any of such
   defined contribution plans
   and
   defined benefit plans.
   (iii)
   Limitation
   In the case of employer contributions to 1 or more
   defined contribution plans
   —
   (I)
   if such contributions do not exceed 6 percent of the compensation otherwise paid or accrued during the taxable year to the beneficiaries under such plans, this paragraph shall not apply to such contributions or to employer contributions to the
   defined benefit plans
   to which this paragraph would otherwise apply by reason of contributions to the
   defined contribution plans
   , and
   (II)
   if such contributions exceed 6 percent of such compensation, this paragraph shall be applied by only taking into account such contributions to the extent of such excess.
   For purposes of this clause, amounts carried over from preceding taxable years under subparagraph (B) shall be treated as employer contributions to 1 or more defined contributions plans to the extent attributable to employer contributions to such plans in such preceding taxable years.
   (iv)
   Guaranteed plans
   In applying this paragraph, any single-employer plan covered under section 4021 of the
   Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
   shall not be taken into account.
   (v)
   Multiemployer plans
   In applying this paragraph, any
   multiemployer plan
   shall not be taken into account.
   (D)
   Insurance contract plans
   For purposes of this paragraph, a plan described in
   section 412(e)(3)
   shall be treated as a
   defined benefit plan.
   (8)
   Self-employed individuals
   In the case of a plan included in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) which provides contributions or benefits for
   employees
   some or all of whom are
   employees
   within the meaning of section 401(c)(1), for purposes of this section—
   (A)
   the term “
   employee
   ” includes an individual who is an
   employee
   within the meaning of section 401(c)(1), and the employer of such individual is the person treated as his employer under section 401(c)(4);
   (B)
   the term “
   earned income
   ” has the meaning assigned to it by section 401(c)(2);
   (C)
   the contributions to such plan on behalf of an individual who is an
   employee
   within the meaning of
   section 401(c)(1)
   shall be considered to satisfy the conditions of section 162 or 212 to the extent that such contributions do not exceed the
   earned income
   of such individual (determined without regard to the deductions allowed by this section) derived from the trade or business with respect to which such plan is established, and to the extent that such contributions are not allocable (determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary) to the purchase of life, accident, health, or other insurance; and
   (D)
   any reference to compensation shall, in the case of an individual who is an
   employee
   within the meaning of section 401(c)(1), be considered to be a reference to the
   earned income
   of such individual derived from the trade or business with respect to which the plan is established.
   (9)
   Certain contributions to employee stock ownership plans
   (A)
   Principal payments
   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (3) and (7), if contributions are paid into a trust which forms a part of an
   employee stock ownership plan
   (as described in section 4975(e)(7)), and such contributions are, on or before the time prescribed in paragraph (6), applied by the plan to the repayment of the principal of a loan incurred for the purpose of acquiring qualifying
   employer securities
   (as described in section 4975(e)(8)), such contributions shall be deductible under this paragraph for the taxable year determined under paragraph (6). The amount deductible under this paragraph shall not, however, exceed 25 percent of the compensation otherwise paid or accrued during the taxable year to the
   employees
   under such
   employee stock ownership plan
   . Any amount paid into such trust in any taxable year in excess of the amount deductible under this paragraph shall be deductible in the succeeding taxable years in order of time to the extent of the difference between the amount paid and deductible in each such succeeding year and the maximum amount deductible for such year under the preceding sentence.
   (B)
   Interest payment
   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (3) and (7), if contributions are made to an
   employee stock ownership plan
   (described in subparagraph (A)) and such contributions are applied by the plan to the repayment of interest on a loan incurred for the purpose of acquiring qualifying
   employer securities
   (as described in subparagraph (A)), such contributions shall be deductible for the taxable year with respect to which such contributions are made as determined under paragraph (6).

   (10)
   Contributions by certain ministers to retirement income accounts
   In the case of contributions made by a minister described in
   section 414(e)(5)
   to a retirement income account described in section 403(b)(9) and not by a person other than such minister, such contributions—
   (A)
   shall be treated as made to a trust which is exempt from tax under section 501(a) and which is part of a plan which is described in section 401(a), and
   (B)
   shall be deductible under this subsection to the extent such contributions do not exceed the limit on
   elective deferrals
   under
   section 402(g)
   or the limit on annual additions under section 415.
   For purposes of this paragraph, all plans in which the minister is a participant shall be treated as one plan.
   (11)
   Determinations relating to deferred compensation
   For purposes of determining under this section—
   (A)
   whether compensation of an
   employee
   is deferred compensation; and
   (B)
   when deferred compensation is paid,
   no amount shall be treated as received by the
   employee
   , or paid, until it is actually received by the
   employee
   .
   (12)
   Definition of compensation
   For purposes of paragraphs (3), (7), (8), and (9) and subsection (h)(1)(C), the term “compensation” shall include amounts treated as “participant’s compensation” under subparagraph (C) or (D) of section 415(c)(3).
   (b)
   Method of contributions, etc., having the effect of a plan; certain deferred benefits
   (1)
   Method of contributions, etc., having the effect of a plan
   If—
   (A)
   there is no plan, but
   (B)
   there is a method or arrangement of employer contributions or compensation which has the effect of a stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, or annuity plan, or other plan deferring the receipt of compensation (including a plan described in paragraph (2)),
   subsection (a) shall apply as if there were such a plan.
   (2)
   Plans providing certain deferred benefits
   (A)
   In general
   For purposes of this section, any plan providing for deferred benefits (other than compensation) for
   employees
   , their spouses, or their dependents shall be treated as a plan deferring the receipt of compensation. In the case of such a plan, for purposes of this section, the determination of when an amount is includible in gross income shall be made without regard to any provisions of this chapter excluding such benefits from gross income.
   (B)
   Exception
   Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any benefit provided through a welfare benefit fund (as defined in
   section 419(e)
   ).
   (c)
   Certain negotiated plans
   If contributions are paid by an employer—
   (1)
   under a plan under which such contributions are held in trust for the purpose of paying (either from principal or income or both) for the benefit of
   employees
   and their families and dependents at least medical or hospital care, or pensions on retirement or death of
   employees
   ; and
   (2)
   such plan was established prior to
   January 1, 1954
   , as a result of an agreement between
   employee
   representatives and the Government of the United States during a period of Government operation, under seizure powers, of a major part of the productive facilities of the industry in which such employer is engaged,
   such contributions shall not be deductible under this section nor be made nondeductible by this section, but the deductibility thereof shall be governed solely by section 162 (relating to trade or business expenses). For purposes of this chapter and subtitle B, in the case of any individual who before
   July 1, 1974
   , was a participant in a plan described in the preceding sentence—
   (A)
   such individual, if he is or was an
   employee
   within the meaning of section 401(c)(1), shall be treated (with respect to service covered by the plan) as being an
   employee
   other than an
   employee
   within the meaning of section 401(c)(1) and as being an
   employee
   of a participating employer under the plan,
   (B)
   earnings derived from service covered by the plan shall be treated as not being
   earned income
   within the meaning of section 401(c)(2), and
   (C)
   such individual shall be treated as an
   employee
   of a participating employer under the plan with respect to service before
   July 1, 1975
   , covered by the plan.
   Section 277 (relating to deductions incurred by certain membership organizations in transactions with members) does not apply to any trust described in this subsection. The first and third sentences of this subsection shall have no application with respect to amounts contributed to a trust on or after any date on which such trust is qualified for exemption from tax under section 501(a).
   (d)
   Deductibility of payments of deferred compensation, etc., to independent contractors
   If a plan would be described in so much of subsection (a) as precedes paragraph (1) thereof (as modified by subsection (b)) but for the fact that there is no employer-
   employee
   relationship, the contributions or compensation—
   (1)
   shall not be deductible by the payor thereof under this chapter, but
   (2)
   shall (if they would be deductible under this chapter but for paragraph (1)) be deductible under this subsection for the taxable year in which an amount attributable to the contribution or compensation is includible in the gross income of the persons participating in the plan.
   (e)
   Contributions allocable to life insurance protection for self-employed individuals
   In the case of a self-employed individual described in section 401(c)(1), contributions which are allocable (determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) to the purchase of life, accident, health, or other insurance shall not be taken into account under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of subsection (a).

   (2)
   Controlled group deductions
   In the case of a payment described in paragraph (1) made by an entity which is liable because it is a member of a commonly
   controlled group
   of corporations, trades, or businesses, within the meaning of subsection (b) or (c) of section 414, the fact that the entity did not directly employ participants of the plan with respect to which the liability payment was made shall not affect the deductibility of a payment which otherwise satisfies the conditions of section 162 (relating to trade or business expenses) or section 212 (relating to expenses for the production of income).
   (3)
   Timing of deduction of contributions
   (A)

   Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
   under section 4022 of such Act.
   (C)
   Contributions to certain trusts
   Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any payment described in paragraph (1) which is made under section 4062(c) of such Act and such payment shall be deductible at such time as may be prescribed in regulations which are based on principles similar to the principles of subsection (a)(1)(A).

   Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
   For purposes of this subsection, any reference to a section of the

   Special rules for simplified employee pensions
   (1)

   Contributions made for a year are deductible—
   (i)
   in the case of a simplified
   employee
   pension maintained on a calendar year basis, for the taxable year with or within which the calendar year ends, or
   (ii)
   in the case of a simplified
   employee
