   (a)
   General rule
   The amount of the taxable income of any
   new loss corporation
   for any
   post-change year
   which may be offset by
   pre-change losses
   shall not exceed the
   section 382
   limitation for such year.
   (b)
   Section 382
   limitation
   For purposes of this section—
   (1)

   limitation for any
   post-change year

   value
   of the
   old loss corporation
   , multiplied by
   (B)
   the long-term tax-exempt rate.
   (2)
   Carryforward of unused limitation
   If the section 382 limitation for any
   post-change year
   exceeds the taxable income of the
   new loss corporation
   for such year which was offset by
   pre-change losses,
   the section 382 limitation for the next
   post-change year
   shall be increased by the amount of such excess.

   (B)
   Limitation for period after change
   For purposes of applying the limitation of subsection (a) to the remainder of the taxable income for such year, the
   section 382
   limitation shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to such limitation (determined without regard to this paragraph) as—

   subsection (h)(1)(A) for
   recognized built-in gains
   for such year, and
