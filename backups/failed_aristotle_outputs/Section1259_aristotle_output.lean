   For purposes of this section—
   (1)

   (2)
   Exceptions
   The term “
   appreciated financial position
   ” shall not include—
   (A)
   any
   position
   with respect to debt if—
   (i)
   the

   (c)
   Constructive sale
   For purposes of this section—
   (1)

   A taxpayer shall be treated as having made a constructive sale of an

   or
   (E)

   positions
   ) that have substantially the same effect as a transaction described in any of the preceding subparagraphs.
   (2)
   Exception for sales of nonpublicly traded property
   A taxpayer shall not be treated as having made a constructive sale solely because the taxpayer enters into a contract for sale of any
   stock
   , debt instrument, or partnership interest which is not a marketable security (as defined in

   ) if the contract settles within 1 year after the date such contract is entered into.
   (3)
   Exception for certain closed transactions
   (A)
   In general

   (ii)
   the taxpayer holds the
   appreciated financial position
   throughout the 60-day period beginning on the date such transaction is closed, and
   (iii)
   at no time during such 60-day period is the taxpayer’s risk of loss with respect to such
   position
   reduced by reason of a circumstance which would be described in
   section 246(c)(4)
   if references to
   stock
   included references to such
   position.
   (B)
   Treatment of certain closed transactions where risk of loss on appreciated financial position diminished
   If—
   (i)
   a transaction, which would otherwise cause a constructive sale of an
   appreciated financial position
   , is closed during the taxable year or during the 30 days thereafter, and
   (ii)
   another transaction is entered into during the 60-day period beginning on the date the transaction referred to in clause (i) is closed—
   (I)
   which would (but for this subparagraph) cause the requirement of subparagraph (A)(iii) not to be met with respect to the transaction described in clause (i) of this subparagraph,
   (II)
   which is closed on or before the 30th day after the close of the taxable year in which the transaction referred to in clause (i) occurs, and
   (III)
   which meets the requirements of clauses (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (A),
   the transaction referred to in clause (ii) shall be disregarded for purposes of determining whether the requirements of subparagraph (A)(iii) are met with respect to the transaction described in clause (i).

   A person is related to another person with respect to a transaction if—
   (A)
   the relationship is described in

   at the time of such
   disposition
   , the transaction resulting in the constructive sale of such
   position

   related person,

   appreciated financial position
   held by the taxpayer, the taxpayer shall be treated as entering into such transaction immediately after such
