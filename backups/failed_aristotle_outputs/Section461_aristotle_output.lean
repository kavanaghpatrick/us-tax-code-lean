   U.S. Code
   Notes

   prev |
   next
   (a)
   General rule
   The amount of any deduction or credit allowed by this subtitle shall be taken for the taxable year which is the proper taxable year under the method of accounting used in computing taxable income.
   (b)
   Special rule in case of death
   In the case of the death of a taxpayer whose taxable income is computed under an accrual method of accounting, any amount accrued as a deduction or credit only by reason of the death of the taxpayer shall not be allowed in computing taxable income for the period in which falls the date of the taxpayer’s death.
   (c)
   Accrual of real property taxes
   (1)
   In general
   If the taxable income is computed under an accrual method of accounting, then, at the election of the taxpayer, any real property tax which is related to a definite period of time shall be accrued ratably over that period.
   (2)
   When election may be made
   (A)
   Without consent
   A taxpayer may, without the consent of the Secretary, make an election under this subsection for his first taxable year in which he incurs real property taxes. Such an election shall be made not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the return for such year (including extensions thereof).
   (B)
   With consent
   A taxpayer may, with the consent of the Secretary, make an election under this subsection at any time.
   (d)
   Limitation on acceleration of accrual of taxes
   (1)
   General rule
   In the case of a taxpayer whose taxable income is computed under an accrual method of accounting, to the extent that the time for accruing taxes is earlier than it would be but for any action of any taxing jurisdiction taken after
   December 31, 1960
   , then, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, such taxes shall be treated as accruing at the time they would have accrued but for such action by such taxing jurisdiction.
   (2)
   Limitation
   Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, paragraph (1) shall be inapplicable to any item of tax to the extent that its application would (but for this paragraph) prevent all persons (including successors in interest) from ever taking such item into account.
   (e)
   Dividends or interest paid on certain deposits or withdrawable accounts
   Except as provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, amounts paid to, or credited to the accounts of, depositors or holders of accounts as dividends or interest on their deposits or withdrawable accounts (if such amounts paid or credited are withdrawable on demand subject only to customary notice to withdraw) by a mutual savings bank not having capital stock represented by shares, a domestic building and loan association, or a cooperative bank shall not be allowed as a deduction for the taxable year to the extent such amounts are paid or credited for periods representing more than 12 months. Any such amount not allowed as a deduction as the result of the application of the preceding sentence shall be allowed as a deduction for such other taxable year as the Secretary determines to be consistent with the preceding sentence.
   (f)
   Contested liabilities
   If—
   (1)
   the taxpayer contests an asserted liability,
   (2)
   the taxpayer transfers money or other property to provide for the satisfaction of the asserted liability,
   (3)
   the contest with respect to the asserted liability exists after the time of the transfer, and
   (4)
   but for the fact that the asserted liability is contested, a deduction would be allowed for the taxable year of the transfer (or for an earlier taxable year) determined after application of subsection (h),
   then the deduction shall be allowed for the taxable year of the transfer. This subsection shall not apply in respect of the deduction for income, war profits, and excess profits taxes imposed by the authority of any foreign country or possession of the United States.
   (g)
   Prepaid interest
   (1)
   In general
   If the taxable income of the taxpayer is computed under the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, interest paid by the taxpayer which, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, is properly allocable to any period—
   (A)
   with respect to which the interest represents a charge for the use or forbearance of money, and
   (B)
   which is after the close of the taxable year in which paid,
   shall be charged to capital account and shall be treated as paid in the period to which so allocable.
   (2)
   Exception
   This subsection shall not apply to points paid in respect of any indebtedness incurred in connection with the purchase or improvement of, and secured by, the principal residence of the taxpayer to the extent that, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, such payment of points is an established business practice in the area in which such indebtedness is incurred, and the amount of such payment does not exceed the amount generally charged in such area.
   (h)
   Certain liabilities not incurred before economic performance
   (1)
   In general
   For purposes of this title, in determining whether an amount has been incurred with respect to any item during any taxable year, the all events test shall not be treated as met any earlier than when
   economic performance
   with respect to such item occurs.
   (2)
   Time when economic performance occurs
   Except as provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the time when
   economic performance
   occurs shall be determined under the following principles:
   (A)
   Services and property provided to the tax­payer
   If the liability of the taxpayer arises out of—
   (i)
   the providing of services to the taxpayer by another person,
   economic performance
   occurs as such person provides such services,
   (ii)
   the providing of property to the taxpayer by another person,
   economic performance
   occurs as the person provides such property, or
   (iii)
   the use of property by the taxpayer,
   economic performance
   occurs as the taxpayer uses such property.
   (B)
   Services and property provided by the taxpayer
   If the liability of the taxpayer requires the taxpayer to provide property or services,
   economic performance
   occurs as the taxpayer provides such property or services.
   (C)
   Workers compensation and tort liabilities of the taxpayer
   If the liability of the taxpayer requires a payment to another person and—
   (i)
   arises under any workers compensation act, or
   (ii)
   arises out of any tort,
   economic performance occurs as the payments to such person are made. Subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not apply to any liability described in the preceding sentence.
   (D)
   Other items
   In the case of any other liability of the taxpayer,
   economic performance
   occurs at the time determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.
   (3)
   Exception for certain recurring items
   (A)
   In general
   Notwithstanding paragraph (1) an item shall be treated as incurred during any taxable year if—
   (i)
   the all events test with respect to such item is met during such taxable year (determined without regard to paragraph (1)),
   (ii)
   economic performance
   with respect to such item occurs within the shorter of—
   (I)
   a reasonable period after the close of such taxable year, or
   (II)
   8½ months after the close of such taxable year,
   (iii)
   such item is recurring in nature and the taxpayer consistently treats items of such kind as incurred in the taxable year in which the requirements of clause (i) are met, and
   (iv)
   either—
   (I)
   such item is not a material item, or
   (II)
   the accrual of such item in the taxable year in which the requirements of clause (i) are met results in a more proper match against income than accruing such item in the taxable year in which
   economic performance
   occurs.
   (B)
   Financial statements considered under subparagraph (A)(iv)
   In making a determination under subparagraph (A)(iv), the treatment of such item on financial statements shall be taken into account.
   (C)
   Paragraph not to apply to workers compensation and tort liabilities
   This paragraph shall not apply to any item described in subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2).
   (4)
   All events test
