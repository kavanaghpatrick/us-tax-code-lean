   eligible educational institutions
   —
   (A)
   under which a person—

   qualified higher education expenses
   of the beneficiary, or
   (ii)
   in the case of a program established and maintained by a State or agency or instrumentality thereof, may make contributions to an account which is established for the purpose of meeting the

   of the account, and
   (B)
   which meets the other requirements of this subsection.
   Except to the extent provided in regulations, a program established and maintained by 1 or more
   eligible educational institutions
   shall not be treated as a
   qualified tuition program
   unless such program provides that amounts are held in a

   qualified tuition program.
   For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term
   “qualified trust”
