   (a)
   General rule
   A
   private activity bond
   issued as part of an issue meets the requirements of this section if the aggregate face amount of the
   private activity bonds
   issued pursuant to such issue, when added to the aggregate face amount of
   tax-exempt
   private activity bonds
   previously issued by the issuing authority during the calendar year, does not exceed such authority’s volume cap for such calendar year.
   (b)
   Volume cap for State agencies
   For purposes of this section—
   (1)
   In general
   The volume cap for any agency of the State authorized to issue
   tax-exempt
   private activity bonds
   for any calendar year shall be 50 percent of the State ceiling for such calendar year.
   (2)
   Special rule where State has more than 1 agency
   If more than 1 agency of the State is authorized to issue
   tax-exempt
   private activity bonds
   , all such agencies shall be treated as a single agency.
   (c)
   Volume cap for other issuers
   For purposes of this section—
   (1)
   In general
   The volume cap for any issuing authority (other than a State agency) for any calendar year shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to 50 percent of the State ceiling for such calendar year as—
   (A)
   the population of the jurisdiction of such issuing authority, bears to
   (B)
   the population of the entire State.
   (2)
   Overlapping jurisdictions
   For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), if an area is within the jurisdiction of 2 or more governmental units, such area shall be treated as only within the jurisdiction of the unit having jurisdiction over the smallest geographical area unless such unit agrees to surrender all or part of such jurisdiction for such calendar year to the unit with overlapping jurisdiction which has the next smallest geographical area.
   (d)
   State ceiling
   For purposes of this section—
   (1)
   In general
   The State ceiling applicable to any State for any calendar year shall be the greater of—
   (A)
   an amount equal to $75 ($62.50 in the case of calendar year 2001) multiplied by the State population, or
   (B)
   $225,000,000 ($187,500,000 in the case of calendar year 2001).
   (2)
   Cost-of-living adjustment
   In the case of a calendar year after 2002, each of the dollar amounts contained in paragraph (1) shall be increased by an amount equal to—
   (A)
   such dollar amount, multiplied by
   (B)
   the cost-of-living adjustment determined under section 1(f)(3) for such calendar year by substituting “calendar year 2001” for “calendar year 2016” in subparagraph (A)(ii) thereof.
   If any increase determined under the preceding sentence is not a multiple of $5 ($5,000 in the case of the dollar amount in paragraph (1)(B)), such increase shall be rounded to the nearest multiple thereof.
   (3)
   Special rule for States with constitutional home rule cities
   For purposes of this section—
   (A)
   In general
   The volume cap for any
   constitutional home rule city
   for any calendar year shall be determined under paragraph (1) of subsection (c) by substituting “100 percent” for “50 percent”.
   (B)
   Coordination with other allocations
   In the case of any State which contains 1 or more constitutional home rule cities, for purposes of applying subsections (b) and (c) with respect to issuing authorities in such State other than constitutional home rule cities, the State ceiling for any calendar year shall be reduced by the aggregate volume caps determined for such year for all constitutional home rule cities in such State.
