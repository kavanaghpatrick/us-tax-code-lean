   (a)
   General rule
   For purposes of section 38, the renewable electricity production credit for any taxable year is an amount equal to the product of—
   (1)
   0.3 cents, multiplied by
   (2)
   the kilowatt hours of electricity—
   (A)
   produced by the taxpayer—
   (i)
   from
   qualified energy resources
   , and
   (ii)
   at a
   qualified facility
   during the 10-year period beginning on the date the facility was originally placed in service, and
   (B)
   sold by the taxpayer to an unrelated person during the taxable year.
   (b)
   Limitations and adjustments
   (1)
   Phaseout of credit
   The amount of the credit determined under subsection (a) shall be reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of the credit (determined without regard to this paragraph) as—
   (A)
   the amount by which the
   reference price
   for the calendar year in which the sale occurs exceeds 8 cents, bears to
   (B)
   3 cents.
   (2)
   Credit and phaseout adjustment based on inflation
   The 0.3 cent amount in subsection (a), the 8 cent amount in paragraph (1), the $4.375 amount in subsection (e)(8)(A), the $2 amount in subsection (e)(8)(D)(ii)(I), and in subsection (e)(8)(B)(i) the
   reference price
   of fuel used as a feedstock (within the meaning of subsection (c)(7)(A)) in 2002 shall each be adjusted by multiplying such amount by the
   inflation adjustment factor
   for the calendar year in which the sale occurs. If the 0.3 cent amount as increased under the preceding sentence is not a multiple of 0.05 cent, such amount shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of 0.05 cent. In any other case, if an amount as increased under this paragraph is not a multiple of 0.1 cent, such amount shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of 0.1 cent.
   (3)
   Credit reduced for tax-exempt bonds
   The amount of the credit determined under subsection (a) with respect to any facility for any taxable year (determined after the application of paragraphs (1) and (2)) shall be reduced by the amount which is the product of the amount so determined for such year and the lesser of 15 percent or a fraction—
   (A)
   the numerator of which is the sum, for the taxable year and all prior taxable years, of proceeds of an issue of any obligations the interest on which is exempt from tax under section 103 and which is used to provide financing for the
   qualified facility
   , and
   (B)
   the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of additions to the capital account for the
   qualified facility
   for the taxable year and all prior taxable years.
   The amounts under the preceding sentence for any taxable year shall be determined as of the close of the taxable year.
   (4)
   Credit rate and period for electricity produced and sold from certain facilities
   (A)
   Credit rate
   In the case of electricity produced and sold in any calendar year after 2003 at any
   qualified facility
   described in paragraph (3), (5), (6), or (7) of subsection (d), the amount in effect under subsection (a)(1) for such calendar year (determined before the application of the last two sentences of paragraph (2) of this subsection) shall be reduced by one-half.
