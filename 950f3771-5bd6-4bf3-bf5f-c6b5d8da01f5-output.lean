   (a)
   General rule
   Except as otherwise provided in this section, on the distribution of
   property
   by a corporation with respect to its stock, the earnings and profits of the corporation (to the extent thereof) shall be decreased by the sum of—
   (1)
   the amount of money,
   (2)
   the principal amount of the obligations of such corporation (or, in the case of obligations having original issue discount, the aggregate issue price of such obligations), and
   (3)
   the adjusted basis of the other
   property
   , so distributed.
   (b)
   Distributions of appreciated property
   On the distribution by a corporation, with respect to its stock, of any
   property
   (other than an obligation of such corporation) the fair market value of which exceeds the adjusted basis thereof—
   (1)
   the earnings and profits of the corporation shall be increased by the amount of such excess, and
   (2)
   subsection (a)(3) shall be applied by substituting “fair market value” for “adjusted basis”.
   For purposes of this subsection and subsection (a), the adjusted basis of any
   property
   is its adjusted basis as determined for purposes of computing earnings and profits.
   (c)
   Adjustments for liabilities
   In making the adjustments to the earnings and profits of a corporation under subsection (a) or (b), proper adjustment shall be made for—
   (1)
   the amount of any liability to which the
   property
   distributed is subject, and
   (2)
   the amount of any liability of the corporation assumed by a shareholder in connection with the distribution.
   (d)
   Certain distributions of stock and securities
   (1)
   In general
   The distribution to a distributee by or on behalf of a corporation of its
   stock or securities
   , of
   stock or securities
   in another corporation, or of
   property,
   in a distribution to which this title applies, shall not be considered a distribution of the earnings and profits of any corporation—
   (A)
   if no gain to such distributee from the receipt of such
   stock or securities
   , or
   property,
   was recognized under this title, or
   (B)
   if the distribution was not subject to tax in the hands of such distributee by reason of section 305(a).
   (2)
   Stock or securities
   For purposes of this subsection, the term “
   stock or securities
   ” includes rights to acquire

   (f)
   Effect on earnings and profits of gain or loss and of receipt of tax-free distributions
   (1)
   Effect on earnings and profits of gain or loss
   The gain or loss realized from the sale or other
   disposition
   (after
   February 28, 1913
   ) of
   property
   by a corporation—
   (A)
   for the purpose of the computation of the earnings and profits of the corporation, shall (except as provided in subparagraph (B)) be determined by using as the adjusted basis the adjusted basis (under the law applicable to the year in which the sale or other
   disposition
   was made) for determining gain, except that no regard shall be had to the value of the
   property
   as of
   March 1, 1913
   ; but
   (B)
   for purposes of the computation of the earnings and profits of the corporation for any period beginning after
   February 28, 1913
   , shall be determined by using as the adjusted basis the adjusted basis (under the law applicable to the year in which the sale or other
   disposition
   was made) for determining gain.
   Gain or loss so realized shall increase or decrease the earnings and profits to, but not beyond, the extent to which such a realized gain or loss was recognized in computing taxable income under the law applicable to the year in which such sale or
   disposition
   was made. Where, in determining the adjusted basis used in computing such realized gain or loss, the adjustment to the basis differs from the adjustment proper for the purpose of determining earnings and profits, then the latter adjustment shall be used in determining the increase or decrease above provided. For purposes of this subsection, a loss with respect to which a deduction is disallowed under section 1091 (relating to wash sales of
   stock or securities
   ), or the corresponding provision of prior law, shall not be deemed to be recognized.
   (2)
   Effect on earnings and profits of receipt of tax-free distributions
   Where a corporation receives (after
   February 28, 1913
   ) a distribution from a second corporation which (under the law applicable to the year in which the distribution was made) was not a taxable dividend to the shareholders of the second corporation, the amount of such distribution shall not increase the earnings and profits of the first corporation in the following cases:
   (A)
   no such increase shall be made in respect of the part of such distribution which (under such law) is directly applied in reduction of the basis of the stock in respect of which the distribution was made; and
   (B)
   no such increase shall be made if (under such law) the distribution causes the basis of the stock in respect of which the distribution was made to be allocated between such stock and the
   property
   received (or such basis would, but for section 307(b), be so allocated).
   (g)
   Earnings and profits—increase in value accrued before
   March 1, 1913
   (1)
   If any increase or decrease in the earnings and profits for any period beginning after
   February 28, 1913
   , with respect to any matter would be different had the adjusted basis of the
   property
   involved been determined without regard to its
   March 1, 1913
   , value, then, except as provided in paragraph (2), an increase (properly reflecting such difference) shall be made in that part of the earnings and profits consisting of increase in value of
   property
   accrued before
   March 1, 1913
   .
   (2)
   If the application of subsection (f) to a sale or other
   disposition
   after
   February 28, 1913
   , results in a loss which is to be applied in decrease of earnings and profits for any period beginning after
   February 28, 1913
   , then, notwithstanding subsection (f) and in lieu of the rule provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the amount of such loss so to be applied shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by which the adjusted basis of the
   property
   used in determining the loss exceeds the adjusted basis computed without regard to the value of the
   property
   on
   March 1, 1913
   , and if such amount so applied in reduction of the decrease exceeds such loss, the excess over such loss shall increase that part of the earnings and profits consisting of increase in value of
   property
   accrued before
   March 1, 1913
   .
   (h)
   Allocation in certain corporate separations and reorganizations
   (1)
   Section 355
   In the case of a distribution or exchange to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) applies, proper allocation with respect to the earnings and profits of the distributing corporation and the controlled corporation (or corporations) shall be made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.
   (2)
   Section 368(a)(1)(C)
   or (D)
   In the case of a reorganization described in subparagraph (C) or (D) of section 368(a)(1), proper allocation with respect to the earnings and profits of the acquired corporation shall, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, be made between the acquiring corporation and the acquired corporation (or any corporation which had
   control
   of the acquired corporation before the reorganization).
   (i)
   Distribution of proceeds of loan insured by the United States
   If a corporation distributes
   property
   with respect to its stock and if, at the time of distribution—
   (1)
   there is outstanding a loan to such corporation which was made, guaranteed, or insured by the United States (or by any agency or instrumentality thereof), and
   (2)
   the amount of such loan so outstanding exceeds the adjusted basis of the
   property
   constituting security for such loan,
   then the earnings and profits of the corporation shall be increased by the amount of such excess, and (immediately after the distribution) shall be decreased by the amount of such excess. For purposes of paragraph (2), the adjusted basis of the
   property
   at the time of distribution shall be determined without regard to any adjustment under section 1016(a)(2) (relating to adjustment for depreciation, etc.). For purposes of this subsection, a commitment to make, guarantee, or insure a loan shall be treated as the making, guaranteeing, or insuring of a loan.

   (1)
   General rule
   For purposes of computing the earnings and profits of a corporation for any taxable year beginning after
   June 30, 1972

   June 30, 1972
   .
   (2)
   Exception
   If for any taxable year a method of depreciation was used by the taxpayer which the Secretary has determined results in a reasonable allowance under section 167(a) and which is the unit-of-production method or other method not expressed in a term of years, then the adjustment to earnings and profits for depreciation for such year shall be determined under the method so used (in lieu of the straight line method).
   (3)
   Exception for tangible property
   (A)
   In general
   Except as provided in subparagraph (B), in the case of tangible
   property

   (ii)
   Special rule
   In the case of a corporation that is a real estate investment trust, any amount deductible under
   section 179D
   shall be allowed in the year in which the
   property
   giving rise to such deduction is placed in service (or, in the case of energy efficient building retrofit
   property,
   the year in which the qualifying final certification is made).
   (4)
   Certain foreign corporations
   The provisions of paragraph (1) shall not apply in computing the earnings and profits of a foreign corporation for any taxable year for which less than 20 percent of the gross income from all sources of such corporation is derived from sources within the United States.
   (5)
   Basis adjustment not taken into account
   In computing the earnings and profits of a corporation for any taxable year, the allowance for depreciation (and amortization, if any) shall be computed without regard to any basis adjustment under section 50(c).
   (l)
