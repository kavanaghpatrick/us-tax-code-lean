   General rule
   A trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under
   section 401(a)
   unless the plan of which such trust is a part provides that an employee’s right to his
   normal retirement benefit
   is nonforfeitable upon the attainment of
   normal retirement age
   (as defined in paragraph (8)) and in addition satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (1), (2), and (11) of this subsection and the requirements of subsection (b)(3), and also satisfies, in the case of a
   defined benefit plan,
   the requirements of subsection (b)(1) and, in the case of a
   defined contribution plan,
   the requirements of subsection (b)(2).

   years of service
   has a nonforfeitable right to 100 percent of the employee’s
   accrued benefit
   derived from employer contributions.
   (iii)

   Certain permitted forfeitures, suspensions, etc.
   For purposes of this subsection—
   (A)
   Forfeiture on account of death
   A right to an
   accrued benefit
   derived from employer contributions shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because the plan provides that it is not payable if the participant dies (except in the case of a survivor annuity which is payable as provided in
   section 401(a)(11)
   ).
   (B)
   Suspension of benefits upon reemployment of retiree
   A right to an
   accrued benefit
   derived from employer contributions shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because the plan provides that the payment of benefits is suspended for such period as the employee is employed, subsequent to the commencement of payment of such benefits—
   (i)
   in the case of a plan other than a multi-employer plan, by the employer who maintains the plan under which such benefits were being paid; and
   (ii)
   in the case of a
   multiemployer plan
   , in the same industry, the same trade or craft, and the same geographic area covered by the plan as when such benefits commenced.
   The Secretary of Labor shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subparagraph, including regulations with respect to the meaning of the term “employed”.
   (C)
   Effect of retroactive plan amendments
   A right to an
   accrued benefit
   derived from employer contributions shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because plan amendments may be given retroactive application as provided in section 412(d)(2).
   (D)
   Withdrawal of mandatory contribution
   (i)
   A right to an
   accrued benefit
   derived from employer contributions shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because the plan provides that, in the case of a participant who does not have a nonforfeitable right to at least 50 percent of his
   accrued benefit
   derived from employer contributions, such
   accrued benefit
   may be forfeited on account of the withdrawal by the participant of any amount attributable to the benefit derived from
   mandatory contributions
   (as defined in subsection (c)(2)(C)) made by such participant.
   (ii)
   Clause (i) shall not apply to a plan unless the plan provides that any
   accrued benefit
   forfeited under a plan provision described in such clause shall be restored upon repayment by the participant of the full amount of the withdrawal described in such clause plus, in the case of a
   defined benefit plan,
   interest. Such interest shall be computed on such amount at the rate determined for purposes of subsection (c)(2)(C) on the date of such repayment (computed annually from the date of such withdrawal). The plan provision required under this clause may provide that such repayment must be made (I) in the case of a withdrawal on account of separation from service, before the earlier of 5
   years
   after the first date on which the participant is subsequently re-employed by the employer, or the close of the first period of 5 consecutive 1
   -year
   breaks in service commencing after the withdrawal; or (II) in the case of any other withdrawal, 5
   years
   after the date of the withdrawal.
   (iii)
   In the case of
   accrued benefits
   derived from employer contributions which accrued before
   September 2, 1974
   , a right to such
   accrued benefit
   derived from employer contributions shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because the plan provides that an amount of such
   accrued benefit
   may be forfeited on account of the withdrawal by the participant of an amount attributable to the benefit derived from
   mandatory contributions
   (as defined in subsection (c)(2)(C)) made by such participant before
   September 2, 1974
   if such amount forfeited is proportional to such amount withdrawn. This clause shall not apply to any plan to which any mandatory contribution is made after
   September 2, 1974
   . The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this clause.
   (iv)
   For purposes of this subparagraph, in the case of any class-
   year
   plan, a withdrawal of employee contributions shall be treated as a withdrawal of such contributions on a plan
   year
   by plan
   year
   basis in succeeding order of time.
   (v)
   For nonforfeitability where the employee has a nonforfeitable right to at least 50 percent of his
   accrued benefit
   , see section 401(a)(19).
   (E)
   Cessation of contributions under a multiemployer plan
   A right to an
   accrued benefit
   derived from employer contributions under a
   multiemployer plan
   shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because the plan provides that benefits accrued as a result of service with the participant’s employer before the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan may not be payable if the employer ceases contributions to the multi­employer plan.
   (F)
   Reduction and suspension of benefits by a multiemployer plan
   A participant’s right to an
   accrued benefit
   derived from employer contributions under a
   multiemployer plan
   shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because—
   (i)
   the plan is amended to reduce benefits under section 4281 of the
   Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
   , or
   (ii)
   benefit payments under the plan may be suspended under section 418E or under section 4281 of the
   Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
   .
   (G)
   Treatment of matching contributions forfeited by reason of excess deferral or contribution or permissible withdrawal
   A matching contribution (within the meaning of
   section 401(m)
   ) shall not be treated as forfeitable merely because such contribution is forfeitable if the contribution to which the matching contribution relates is treated as an excess contribution under section 401(k)(8)(B), an excess deferral under section 402(g)(2)(A), a permissible withdrawal under section 414(w), or an excess aggregate contribution under section 401(m)(6)(B).
   (4)
   Service included in determination of nonforfeitable percentage
   In computing the period of service under the plan for purposes of determining the nonforfeitable percentage under paragraph (2), all of an employee’s
   years of service
   with the employer or employers maintaining the plan shall be taken into account, except that the following may be disregarded:

   accrued benefit
   under the plan, the plan may disregard service performed by the employee with respect to which he has received—

   a distribution of the present value of his entire nonforfeitable benefit if such distribution was in an amount (not more than the dollar limit under
   section 411(a)(11)(A)
   ) permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, or
   (ii)
   a distribution of the present value of his nonforfeitable benefit attributable to such service which he elected to receive.
   Clause (i) of this subparagraph shall apply only if such distribution was made on termination of the employee’s participation in the plan. Clause (ii) of this subparagraph shall apply only if such distribution was made on termination of the employee’s participation in the plan or under such other circumstances as may be provided under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.

   years
   after the date of the withdrawal.

   For purposes of this section, the term “
   normal retirement benefit
   ” means the greater of the
   early retirement benefit
   under the plan, or the benefit under the plan commencing at
   normal retirement age.
   The
   normal retirement benefit
   shall be determined without regard to—
   (A)
   medical benefits, and
   (B)
   disability benefits not in excess of the qualified disability benefit.
   For purposes of this paragraph, a qualified disability benefit is a disability benefit provided by a plan which does not exceed the benefit which would be provided for the participant if he separated from the service at
   normal retirement age
   . For purposes of this paragraph, the
   early retirement benefit
   under a plan shall be determined without regard to any benefits commencing before benefits payable under title II of the
   Social Security Act
   become payable which—
   (i)
   do not exceed such social security benefits, and
   (ii)
   terminate when such social security benefits commence.
   (10)
   Changes in vesting schedule
   (A)
   General rule
   A plan amendment changing any vesting schedule under the plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of paragraph (2) if the nonforfeitable percentage of the
   accrued benefit
   derived from employer contributions (determined as of the later of the date such amendment is adopted, or the date such amendment becomes effective) of any employee who is a participant in the plan is less than such nonforfeitable percentage computed under the plan without regard to such amendment.
   (B)
   Election of former schedule
   A plan amendment changing any vesting schedule under the plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of paragraph (2) unless each participant having not less than 3
   years of service
   is permitted to elect, within a reasonable period after the adoption of such amendment, to have his nonforfeitable percentage computed under the plan without regard to such amendment.
   (11)
   Restrictions on certain mandatory distributions
   (A)
   In general
   If the present value of any nonforfeitable
   accrued benefit
   exceeds $7,000, a plan meets the requirements of this paragraph only if such plan provides that such benefit may not be immediately distributed without the consent of the participant.
   (B)
   Determination of present value

   This paragraph shall not apply to any distribution of dividends to which
   section 404(k)
   applies.
   (D)
   Special rule for rollover contributions
   A plan shall not fail to meet the requirements of this paragraph if, under the terms of the plan, the present value of the nonforfeitable
   accrued benefit
   is determined without regard to that portion of such benefit which is attributable to
   rollover contributions
   (and earnings allocable thereto). For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “
   rollover contributions
