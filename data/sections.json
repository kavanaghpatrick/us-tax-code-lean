Background. The Act is the single largest and most ambitious investment in the ability of the United States to advance clean energy, cut consumer energy costs, confront the climate crisis, promote environmental justice, and strengthen energy security, among other vital provisions that will lower costs for families, reduce the deficit, and grow and strengthen the economy. The Act will:\n(a) build on the once-in-a-generation investment in the infrastructure and competitiveness of the United States set forth in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (\nPublic Law 117\u201358\n) [see Tables for classification] by accelerating the deployment of clean energy technologies, making home energy efficiency and clean energy installations more affordable, and incentivizing the purchase of electric vehicles;\n(b) boost energy security and lower energy costs for families, businesses, and government;\n(c) revitalize American manufacturing by investing in domestic clean energy supply chains and creating well-paying union jobs, including in traditional energy communities;\n(d) improve public health and advance environmental justice and economic opportunity for frontline communities who disproportionately bear the brunt of cumulative exposure to industrial and energy pollution;\n(e) promote climate justice by reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions in line with the goal of realizing net-zero emissions by no later than 2050;\n(f) harness nature-based solutions\u2014including climate-smart agriculture and forestry\u2014that deliver economic benefits for rural communities, Tribes, farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners;\n(g) expand research and accelerate innovation in the development of clean energy, climate, and related technologies; and\n(h) increase the resilience of our communities in the face of a changing climate.\nAchieving these goals will require effective implementation of the Act by my Administration, as well as by State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments.\nSec.\n2.

There is hereby established the\nWhite House Office\non Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation within the\nExecutive Office of the President\n, which shall coordinate the policymaking process with respect to implementing the energy and infrastructure provisions of the Act and other essential initiatives.

taxable year and there is any reduction in the qualified basis of such building which results in an increase in tax under this subsection for such taxable or any subsequent taxable year, then\u2014\n(i)\nthe statutory period for the assessment of any deficiency with respect to such increase in tax shall not expire before the expiration of 3 years from the date the Secretary is notified by the taxpayer (in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe) of such reduction in qualified basis, and\n(ii)\nsuch deficiency may be assessed before the expiration of such 3-year period

49(a)(1)(D)(iv)(II).\n(B)\nFinancing secured by property\nThe requirements of this subparagraph are met with respect to any financing if such financing is secured by the\nqualified low-income

value of financing\nIf the rate of interest on any financing described in paragraph (2)(A) is less than the rate which is 1 percentage point below the applicable Federal rate as of the time such financing is incurred, then the qualified basis (to which such financing relates) of the\nqualified low-income building\nshall be the present value of the amount of such financing, using as the discount rate such applicable Federal rate. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the rate of interest on any financing shall be determined by treating interest to the extent of government subsidies as not payable.\n(4)\nFailure to fully repay\n(A)\nIn general\nTo the extent that the requirements of paragraph (2)(D) are not met, then the taxpayer\u2019s tax under this chapter for the taxable year in which such failure occurs shall be

the due date for the filing of the return of tax imposed by chapter 1 for the 1st taxable year for which such credit was allowable, and\n(ii)\nending with the due date for the taxable year in which

election made under subsection (g) with respect to the\nqualified low-income housing project\nof which such building is a part, and\n(E)\nsuch other information as the Secretary may require.\nIn the case of a failure to make the certification required by the preceding sentence on the date prescribed therefor, unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, no credit shall be allowable by reason of subsection (a) with respect to such building for any taxable year ending before such certification is made.\n(2)\nAnnual reports to the Secretary\nThe Secretary may require taxpayers to submit an information return (at such time and in such form and manner as the Secretary prescribes) for each taxable year setting forth\u2014\n(A)\nthe qualified basis for the taxable year of each\nqualified low-income building\nof the taxpayer,\n(B)\nthe information described in paragraph (1)(C) for the taxable year,

year,\n(B)\nsufficient information to identify each such building and the taxpayer with respect thereto, and\n(C)\nsuch other information as the Secretary may require.\nThe penalty under\nsection
