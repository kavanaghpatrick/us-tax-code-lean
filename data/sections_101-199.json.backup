For purposes of the preceding sentence, each spouse shall be treated as owning the property during the period that either spouse owned the property.\n(3)\nApplication to only 1 sale or exchange every 2 years\nSubsection (a) shall not apply to any sale or exchange by the taxpayer if, during the 2-year period ending on the date of such sale or exchange, there was any other sale or exchange by the

to\n(ii)\nthe period such property was owned by the taxpayer.\n(C)\nPeriod of nonqualified use\nFor purposes of this paragraph\u2014\n(i)\nIn general\nThe term \u201c\nperiod of nonqualified

employer securities\n(a)\nIn general\nGross income does not include 50 percent of the interest received by\u2014\n(1) a bank (within the meaning of\nsection 581\n),\n(2) an insurance company to which subchapter L applies,\n(3) a corporation actively engaged in the business of lending money, or\n(4) a regulated investment company (as defined in\nsection 851\n),\nwith respect to a securities acquisition loan.\n(b)\nSecurities acquisition loan\n(1)\nIn general\nFor purposes of this section, the term \u201csecurities acquisition loan\u201d means\u2014\n(A) any loan to a corporation or to an\nemployee\nstock ownership plan to the extent that the proceeds are used to acquire employer securities for the plan, or\n(B) any loan to a corporation to the extent that, within 30 days, employer securities are transferred to the plan in an amount equal to the proceeds of such loan and such securities are allocable to accounts of plan participants within 1 year of the date of such loan.\nFor purposes of this paragraph, the term \u201cemployer securities\u201d has the meaning given such term by\nsection 409(l).\nThe term \u201csecurities acquisition loan\u201d shall not include a loan with a term greater than 15 years.\n(2)\nLoans between related persons\nThe term \u201csecurities acquisition loan\u201d shall not include\u2014\n(A) any loan made between corporations which are members of the same controlled group of corporations, or\n(B) any loan made between an\nemployee\nstock ownership plan and any person that is\u2014\n(i) the employer of any\nemployees\nwho are covered by the plan; or\n(ii) a member of a controlled group of corporations which includes such employer.\nFor purposes of this paragraph, subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not apply to any loan which, but for such subparagraphs, would be a securities acquisition loan if such loan was not originated by the employer of any\nemployees\nwho are covered by the plan or by any member of the controlled group of corporations which includes such employer, except that this section shall not apply to any interest received on such loan during such time as such loan is held by such employer (or any member of such controlled group).\n(3)\nTerms applicable to certain securities acquisition loans\nA loan to a corporation shall not fail to be treated as a securities acquisition loan merely because the proceeds of such loan are lent to an\nemployee\nstock ownership plan sponsored by such corporation (or by any member of the controlled group of corporations which includes such corporation) if such loan includes\u2014\n(A) repayment terms which are substantially similar to the terms of the loan of such corporation from a lender described in subsection (a), or\n(B) repayment terms providing for more

construction, reconstruction, or improvement of land or property of a character subject to the allowance for depreciation, or\n(B)\nto redeem part or all of a prior issue which was issued for purposes described in subparagraph (A) or this subparagraph.\n(2)\nCertain prior issues taken into account\nIf\u2014\n(A)\nthe proceeds of 2 or more issues of\nbonds\n(whether or not the issuer of each such issue is the same) are or will be used primarily with respect to facilities located in the same incorporated municipality or located in the same county (but not in any incorporated

of prior law) would apply to each such issue,\nthen, for purposes of paragraph (1), in determining the aggregate face amount of any later issue there shall be taken into account the aggregate face amount of\ntax-exempt\nbonds\nissued under all prior such issues and outstanding at the time of such later issue (not including as outstanding any\nbond\nwhich is to be redeemed (other than in an advance refunding) from the\nnet proceeds\nof the later issue).\n(3)\nRelated persons\nFor purposes of this subsection, a person is a related person to another person if\u2014\n(A)\nthe relationship

general\nAt the election of the issuer with respect to any issue, this subsection shall be applied\u2014\n(i)\nby substituting \u201c$10,000,000\u201d for \u201c$1,000,000\u201d in paragraph (1),

subparagraph are facilities\u2014\n(i)\nlocated in the same incorporated municipality or located in the same county (but not in any incorporated municipality), and\n(ii)\nthe principal user of which

question in a Federal or State law or local ordinance of general application or required by a change made after such date in rules and regulations of general application issued under such a law or ordinance,\n(iii)\nrequired by circumstances which could not be reasonably foreseen on such date of issue or arising out of a mistake of law or fact (but the aggregate amount of expenditures not taken into account under this clause with respect to any issue shall not exceed $1,000,000), or\n(iv)\ndescribed in clause (i) or (ii) of\nsection 41(b)(2)(A)\nfor which a deduction was allowed under section 174A(a),\nshall not be taken into account.\n(D)\nLimitation on loss of tax exemption\nIn applying subparagraph (A)(ii) with respect to capital expenditures made after the date of any issue, no\nbond\nissued as a part of such issue shall cease to be treated as a\nqualified small issue bond\nby reason of any such expenditure for any period before the date on which such expenditure is paid or incurred.\n(E)\nCertain refinancing issues\nIn the case of any issue described in paragraph (1)(B), an election may be made under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph only if all of the prior issues being redeemed are issues to which paragraph (1) (or the corresponding provision of prior law) applied. In applying subparagraph (A)(ii) with respect to such a refinancing issue, capital expenditures shall be taken into account only for purposes of determining whether the prior issues being redeemed qualified (and would have continued to qualify) under paragraph (1) (or the corresponding provision of prior law).\n(F)\nAggregate amount of capital expenditures where there is urban development action grant\nIn the case of any issue 95 percent or more of the\nnet proceeds\nof which are to be used to provide facilities with respect to which an urban development action grant has been made under section 119 of the\nHousing and Community Development Act of 1974\n, capital expenditures of not to exceed $10,000,000 shall not be taken into account for purposes of applying subparagraph (A)(ii).

facility.\n(7)\nSubsection not to apply if bonds issued with certain other tax-exempt bonds\nThis subsection shall not apply to any\nbond\nissued as part of an issue (other than an issue to which paragraph (4) applies) if the interest on any other\nbond\nwhich is part of such issue is excluded from gross income under any provision of law other than this subsection.\n(8)\nRestrictions on financing certain facilities\nThis subsection shall not apply to an issue if\u2014\n(A)\nmore than 25 percent of the\nnet proceeds\nof the issue are to be used to provide a facility the primary

In the case of an activity which consists in major part of the breeding, training, showing, or racing of horses, the preceding sentence shall be applied by substituting \u201c2\u201d for \u201c3\u201d and \u201c7\u201d for \u201c5\u201d.\n(e)\nSpecial rule\n(1)\nIn general\nA determination as to whether the presumption provided by subsection (d) applies with respect to any activity shall, if the taxpayer so elects, not be made before the close of the fourth taxable year (sixth taxable year, in the case of an activity described in the last sentence of such subsection) following the taxable year in which the taxpayer first engages in the activity.\n(2)\nInitial period\nIf the taxpayer makes an election under paragraph (1), the presumption provided by subsection (d) shall apply to each taxable year in the 5-taxable year (or 7-taxable year) period beginning with the taxable year in which the taxpayer first engages in the activity, if the gross income derived from the activity for 3 (or 2 if applicable) or more of the taxable years in such period exceeds the deductions attributable to the activity (determined without regard to whether or not the activity is engaged in for profit).\n(3)\nElection\nAn election under paragraph (1) shall be made at such time and manner, and subject to such terms and conditions, as the Secretary may prescribe.\n(4)\nTime for assessing deficiency attributable to activity\nIf a taxpayer makes an election under paragraph (1) with respect to an activity, the statutory period for the assessment of any deficiency attributable to such activity shall not expire before the expiration of 2 years after the date prescribed by law (determined without extensions) for filing the return of tax under chapter 1 for the last taxable year in the period of 5 taxable years (or 7 taxable years) to which the election relates. Such deficiency may be assessed notwithstanding the provisions of any law or rule of law which would otherwise prevent such an assessment.\n(Added\nPub.
