   supplemental unemployment compensation benefits
   ,
   (ii)
   such benefits are payable to employees under a classification which is set forth in the plan and which is found by the Secretary not to be discriminatory in favor of employees who are highly compensated employees (within the meaning of
   section 414(q)
   ), and

   (iii)
   merely because the plan provides only for employees who are not eligible under another plan (which meets the requirements of subparagraph (A)) of
   supplemental unemployment compensation benefits
   provided wholly by the employer the same benefits (or a portion of such benefits if determined in a nondiscriminatory manner) which such employees would receive under such other plan if such employees were eligible under such other plan, but only if the employees eligible under both plans would make a classification which would be nondiscriminatory within the meaning of subparagraph (A).
   (C)
   A plan shall be considered to meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) during the whole of any year of the plan if on one day in each quarter it satisfies such requirements.
   (D)
   The term “
   supplemental unemployment compensation benefits
   ” means only—
   (i)
   benefits which are paid to an employee because of his involuntary separation from the employment of the employer (whether or not such separation is temporary) resulting directly from a reduction in force, the discontinuance of a plant or operation, or other similar conditions, and
   (ii)
   sick and accident benefits subordinate to the benefits described in clause (i).
   (E)
   Exemption shall not be denied under subsection (a) to any organization entitled to such exemption as an association described in paragraph (9) of this subsection merely because such organization provides for the payment of supplemental unemployment benefits (as defined in subparagraph (D)(i)).
   (18)
   A trust or trusts created before
   June 25, 1959
   , forming part of a plan providing for the payment of benefits under a pension plan funded only by contributions of employees, if—
   (A)
   under the plan, it is impossible, at any time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities with respect to employees under the plan, for any part of the corpus or income to be (within the taxable year or thereafter) used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than the providing of benefits under the plan,
   (B)
   such benefits are payable to employees under a classification which is set forth in the plan and which is found by the Secretary not to be discriminatory in favor of employees who are highly compensated employees (within the meaning of
   section 414(q)
   ),
   (C)
   such benefits do not discriminate in favor of employees who are highly compensated employees (within the meaning of section 414(q)). A plan shall not be considered discriminatory within the meaning of this subparagraph merely because the benefits received under the plan bear a uniform relationship to the total compensation, or the basic or regular rate of compensation, of the employees covered by the plan, and
   (D)
   in the case of a plan under which an employee may designate certain contributions as deductible—
   (i)
   such contributions do not exceed the amount with respect to which a deduction is allowable under section 219(b)(3),
   (ii)
   requirements similar to the requirements of
   section 401(k)(3)(A)(ii)
   are met with respect to such elective contributions,
   (iii)
   such contributions are treated as elective deferrals for purposes of section 402(g), and
   (iv)
   the requirements of
   section 401(a)(30)
   are met.
   For purposes of subparagraph (D)(ii), rules similar to the rules of
   section 401(k)(8)
   shall apply. For purposes of section 4979, any excess contribution under clause (ii) shall be treated as an excess contribution under a cash or deferred arrangement.
   (19)
   A post or organization of past or present members of the Armed Forces of the United States, or an auxiliary unit or society of, or a trust or foundation for, any such post or organization—
   (A)
   organized in the United States or any of its possessions,
   (B)
   at least 75 percent of the members of which are past or present members of the Armed Forces of the United States and substantially all of the other members of which are individuals who are cadets or are spouses, widows, widowers, ancestors, or lineal descendants of past or present members of the Armed Forces of the United States or of cadets, and
   (C)
