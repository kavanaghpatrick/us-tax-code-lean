   Pub. L. 97–248
   substituted provision that a distribution shall be treated as in complete liquidation if the distribution is one of a series in redemption of all the stock pursuant to a plan for provision that a distribution was to be treated as in partial liquidation if the distribution was one of a series in redemption of all the stock pursuant to a plan, or the distribution was not essentially equivalent to a dividend, was in redemption of part of the stock pursuant to a plan, and occurred within the taxable year or the next taxable year of the plan being adopted, including but not limited to a distribution which met the requirements of former subsec. (b) of this section, and that for the purposes of sections 562(b) and 6043 of this title, a partial liquidation included a redemption of stock to which

   struck out subsec. (c) which provided that the fact that, with respect to a shareholder, a distribution qualified under section 302(a) by reason of section 302(b) would not be taken into account in determining whether the distribution, with respect to such shareholder, was also a distribution in partial liquidation of the corporation.
