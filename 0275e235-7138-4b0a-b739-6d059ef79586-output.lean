   qualified reclamation or closing costs
   for any taxable year to which such election applies shall be equal to the current reclamation or closing costs allocable to—

   in the case of qualified closing costs, the production from the
   reserve property
   during such taxable year.
   (2)

   (A)
   Opening balance
   The opening balance of any reserve for its first taxable year shall be zero.
   (B)
   Increase for interest
   A reserve shall be increased each taxable year by an amount equal to the amount of interest which would have been earned during such taxable year on the opening balance of such reserve for such taxable year if such interest were computed—

   Any amount paid by the taxpayer during any taxable year for

   of the taxpayer for all portions of the
   reserve property
   disturbed during any taxable year to which the election under paragraph (1) applies.
   (B)
   Closing costs reserves
   In the case of any reserve for qualified closing costs, there shall be included in gross income for any taxable year an amount equal to the excess of—
   (i)
   the closing balance of the reserve for such taxable year, over
   (ii)
   the current closing cost of the taxpayer with respect to the
   reserve property
   , determined as if all production with respect to the
   reserve property
   for any taxable year to which the election under paragraph (1) applies had occurred in such taxable year.
   (C)
   Order of application
   This paragraph shall be applied after all adjustments to the reserve have been made for the taxable year.

   disposition
   of any portion, of a
   reserve property
   .

   Allocation for property where election not in effect for all taxable years
   If the election under subsection (a)(1) is not in effect for 1 or more taxable years in which the reserved
